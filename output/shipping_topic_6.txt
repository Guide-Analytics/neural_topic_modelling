304 They are offering me $100 for losing my goods [0.43909314]
305 This is my first time using them and has been my worst experience so far [0.9856599]
306 I feel very sad about this [0.97383237]
307 These people are criminals [0.98322153]
310 This is my first time using this platform (ShipBob) and it is very intuitive and super simple to setup and use [0.9866736]
313 From the first contact Aaron Hodes and then Dominique Roman we felt supported and informed where whenever we had an issue or a question they were right on it and highly responsive [0.5774917]
314 The only reason for 4 stars rather than five was on the basis that although the goods arrived at the center on the 20th of Feb they were apparently only processed on the 24th [0.45256805]
315 However we were very happy with Dominque's assistance and that of Aaron who kept in the loop [0.90634185]
316 The ShipBob team right from the start gave me very personal attention [0.8833727]
317 They took the time to learn about my business and also to find solutions to solve complicated logistics issues having to do with my brands custom packing requirements [0.61744183]
318 I can't image another company approaching this type of service with so much personal care transparency enthusiasm and creativity [0.4985594]
320 They scheduled multiple screen-share sessions with me over Zoom (always with the same helpful person assigned to my account) to make sure I was an expert at the process by the time our partnership went online [0.91858655]
322 Shipbob has played an integral role in our companies success [0.7131496]
324 They jumped into our chaotic situation with both feet without hesitation [0.912608]
326 I don't know what mockr would have done without them [0.7018215]

350 I have had WRO's broken and discarded before I could make a claim with my insurance company [0.4330976]
351 I wish that the merchant care specialists were on site in the warehouse so that communication was faster [0.73586506]
353 I think that’s really all it boils down to [0.76865184]
360 Overall quite responsive [0.8159534]
361 There are still bugs in the system and I've had to raise the problems each time [0.934919]

378 I have had the most amazing experience during onboarding and day to day operations [0.5730803]
379 I have tried other 3PLs before and nothing compares to ShipBob - they have the most intuitive easy to use platform dedicated team and fast turn around time [0.7415523]
381 I have found Shipbob and their team to be incredibly valuable to my different clients businesses [0.80834496]
382 I am located in the UK and my clients often don't live in the US so having a fulfilment company that are organized and very reliable provides great peace of mind [0.84414065]
385 My clients businesses wouldn't function anything like as efficiently if it wasn't for Shipbob and the team so highly recommend them [0.9952002]

402 Very pleased with how well they do a difficult job [0.75520426]
403 The implementation process with ShipBob was a breeze thanks largely to our implementation specialist Taylor S [0.9399447]
404 We still bother her with issues (usually of our own making) from time to time and she is always happy to help [0.9863941]
408 I'm very satisfied with ShioBob's platform is very user-friendly and compatible with good e-commerce platforms [0.98907834]
409 Great packaging solutions and a helpful team [0.93939924]
410 Worst company ever [0.4182802]
411 They will cost your business a lot of money in the long run [0.5905363]
412 They are also charge nearly 2x the price of Amazon FBA and other fulfilment services [0.65317976]
414 Don't do business with Shipbob [0.55188596]
415 I don't know what happened to this business [0.57395303]
418 I don't know where to turn [0.88097703]
419 I am out of stock and every day I am loosing money [0.9983208]
420 Looks like my business is hijacked by them [0.98068297]
421 We run a small non profit corporation and I am just amazed that anyone uses Shipbob [0.9969579]
422 We travel a lot so we do not have the luxery of doing our own fullfillment [0.6288255]
423 My wife has had previous experience with them [0.91565555]
425 Boy were we wrong [0.7793982]
432 ShipBob has made the initial steps simple and straightforward [0.8948794]
433 I'm excited about moving forward with them [0.68264204]
437 Shipbob has helped us grow our business over the past 4 years [0.92420596]
438 Their dashboard and technology help manage our day to day operations [0.83245087]
439 Great technology and responsive account managers and support teams [0.7295893]
440 A pleasure to do business with [0.5525234]
445 I went to these guys because the pitch is great [0.9864278]
447 Problem is it is a bait and switch [0.98637915]
449 So it may be 1 state away but still 4 to 7 days [0.92660964]
453 Double [0.8229693]
460 Clearly an industry leader [0.8677898]
462 Highly recommend [0.9960086]
463 Shipbob's service is responsive transparent and easy to use [0.41339996]
474 I haven't had anything arise that wasn't handled within the day [0.71164083]
475 Even as my business scales up I wouldn't think of using anyone else [0.55230975]
478 I work with Shipbob for over 2 years now [0.96706873]
479 What Shipbob is not telling you before you sign the contract with them is that they charge you extra holiday surcharge which is an EXTRA $1 [0.9000878]
481 They also charges an extra $1 [0.5414804]
482 50 which they call COVID surcharges that we as a seller have to pay per order [0.65376467]
485 Both are really bringing out the best in their people and performance [0.9831542]
486 The many "obstacles" this year actually made them (and us) stronger companies [0.64555836]
487 So fortunate to call ShipBob a partner in our e-commerce journey [0.5589957]
489 I just started with them and so far so good [0.8920812]
490 It was easy to get set up and integrate with my three online stores [0.9903922]
494 I do NOT recommend [0.99600905]
497 After a month our warehousing fees were around $2200 [0.5314545]
498 After trying to figure out with them how it got there a month had gone by and it currently stands at $3700 [0.7352172]
499 If you're wondering how it got that high it's because they store your items based on how they can profit as much as they can from you [0.48047498]
500 Keep in mind my products are stationery/office supplies so you have stickers tapes notebooks pens etc [0.85189176]
501 Storing them myself I would've used 1-2 standard shelf space (items unpacked obviously) [0.4240937]
502 So where are they storing my items [0.4817982]
503 They are being kept in 339 bins 2 shelves and 1 pallet [0.44960716]
505 That's a total of about $1750 per month [0.75584567]
509 They are trained to do the opposite [0.98305744]
510 You cannot request them to store your items in a certain way either so it means that they decide how much to charge you on warehousing [0.599152]
514 Despite what others have said here on the reviews I went ahead and tried anyway [0.8310694]
515 Turns out it's just as bad as they say [0.7982963]
516 If you value your time look elsewhere [0.49646306]
517 Mark Davis is so knowledgeable and went the extra mile to ensure I understood the Shipbob process [0.9842785]
519 I have had an amazing experience with ShipBob [0.9145492]
520 Sai went out of his way to make sure I was set up and had everything I needed as I ramped up [0.98164725]
522 I am a huge fan and highly recommend [0.9977591]
523 I have been trying for days to resolve an issue I have called several times to speak with a supervisor [0.96653587]
527 Avoid ShipBob at all costs [0.62993294]
535 Avoid at all costs [0.53890467]
536 Nicole and everyone from the implementation team were really helpful [0.9252492]
537 With their help we have been able to understand the ShipBob platform as well as connect it with the API from our system [0.80461246]
538 Great job [0.7542081]
539 Dino ROOT Wellness [0.8691063]
542 It was a nightmare to work with shipbob [0.9823501]
543 Very bad experience [0.91450745]
544 ShipBob has been instrumental in our US launch [0.9644811]
545 We were fully onboarded and had walkthroughs of the platform prior to our launch to ensure we were up to speed [0.9211468]
547 I would highly recommend ShipBob to anyone [0.99600834]
549 And while there is a lot of information about how to do things on the ShipBob site there was nothing like being walked through the implementation [0.70397466]
551 There were also some interesting issues with the product scans and the unit weights but she solved them within 24 hours [0.8177919]
553 ShipBob met all and bettered most of their SLAs [0.4246354]
554 As a startup business with an international clientele I wouldn't be able to trade without ShipBob as a partner [0.930711]

559 You can tell why the company is growing so quickly [0.8809925]
560 Samantha was very helpful and is a credit to the onboarding process [0.72090137]

567 From the very first meeting with an account executive all the way up to my implementation specialist I always felt like I was in good hands [0.44869152]
568 They explained the whole process from A-Z with the utmost patience and clarity [0.9419018]
573 Many other business owners recommended them to me and I have not been disspointed [0.9251605]
574 They have a great system they follow and platform that works flawlessly [0.89847636]
576 You'll have multiple contacts that talk to you daily to answer any questions [0.44567573]
577 Highly recommend [0.9960086]
578 It's deserved minus 5 stars [0.8566901]
579 Terrible Terrible experience [0.91450745]
580 It's going 3rd week i can't integrate with my wix shop [0.9918946]
581 Support just sucks they replied whatever they want [0.9977478]
585 Stay a way don't waste your $ and time especially if you on wix use someone else's [0.74014497]
586 It really is a great experience so far [0.98642284]

590 The guys at ShipBob are great [0.98321337]
591 The growing pains of a new startup company are real and things went from 0 to 100 with my company SO fast [0.47810254]
594 Their app is super easy to use and syncs well with Shopify [0.40536606]
595 And they have someone there to help you every step of the way [0.9031848]
596 Overall I highly recommend ShipBob and they’re the company I always recommend to my family and friends also with e-commerce businesses [0.9944963]
599 The only thing they'd do is 'reimburse' you a few dollars [0.9861752]
600 I can't tell you how grateful I am to have found Kendra [0.999442]
602 I love her honesty & authenticity & I'm so excited about all the time & energy I'm going to be saving by switching out of my garage & into Shipbob [0.9236982]
604 "It just works" without hidden fees and with lots of help from the onboarding team [0.69710654]
605 (Thanks Paige and Nicholas [0.82334346]
607 Paige and Robert were very helpful in getting me set up on ShipBob [0.86282086]
609 5/5 Would recommend using ShipBob to other eCommerce sellers [0.6316085]
610 I'm sure some people have a good experience with ShipBob [0.9137906]
612 Most importantly for small business owners it is ridiculously expensive [0.9854008]
615 Outrageous [0.9478737]
617 The labels were dirty and scuffed up when my products were returned [0.737193]
618 All bad for building a brand [0.5774787]
619 Not recommended at all [0.9487818]
620 Working with Shipbob has been a pleasure [0.970385]
621 They helped us with the set up of the account and made a great follow up [0.4505482]
623 Smooth integration excellent communication and easy to understand dashboard [0.7663081]

626 Highly recommend [0.9960086]
627 They started to send the products after a call and talking with employees through linkedin [0.7058379]
630 Their services and tools are great and their service and responsiveness is above par compared to other organizations we have worked with [0.46967798]
631 I highly recommend Shipbob [0.99600846]
634 Sometimes live chat is not live but i have to wait longer but issues are always solved [0.98631215]
636 That would be a huge plus [0.9257791]
637 Easy for a novice to understand the directions [0.92095685]
638 Everything was easily accomplished thanks to the tutorials [0.98239917]

643 ShipBob has been useful for our company [0.60725987]
645 There are slight problems most of them are fixed [0.97888756]
647 Karleyann from shipbob helped us through the entire process [0.94210213]
652 I highly recommend if you travel a lot and you would like to outsource your logistics [0.94147277]
653 The system is intuitive and easy to use [0.97935575]
659 I spoke to a rep who I assume was higher up in the chain he said that this may be possible but would need to reach out to his team and would confirm within a week [0.9187164]
663 Great platform very easy to use [0.9363343]
665 Support are always pretty quick to respond as well just in case you have questions [0.99852693]
666 ShipBob has caused months of business outages that have cost our small company $20k+ in cash burn [0.48711717]
669 Their own employees tell us that they aren't even surprised any longer at the incompetence and issues at this company [0.454413]
670 They tell us they know about all the issues and that they don't have answers [0.5976856]
671 I feel bad for them [0.9739631]
674 They will ruin your business [0.5569329]
675 Look at all of the reviews [0.82641345]
676 They have over $60M in funding [0.7644227]
677 The exec team has laughed their way to the bank and they don't care anymore [0.6615847]
679 Shipbob have been useful to our company [0.6105924]
681 It has been a lifesaver to be able to sell our essential oil blend doheaven Shield [0.7886597]
686 They are fast and really know what they are talking about and go the extra step to help me [0.9823006]
687 In terms of their whole system I am having great success with just about every aspect of the business [0.9915133]
688 Great platform with excellent support and interface [0.8689324]
690 Highly Recommended [0.95109314]
693 I didn’t think my experience could get any lower with shipbob but here we are [0.98245513]
698 They said that sometimes they just count incorrectly [0.83978283]
699 This was during a recorded call on August 14 2020 (mentioning dates cause they love to contact Trustpilot denying their incompetence) [0.50472724]
703 I was correct [0.9804622]
707 50 without informing me of the cost change [0.431533]
708 When I asked about this - no response [0.81710285]
711 - Your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up [0.7056531]
715 - Your kitting will never be ready on time [0.9353229]
717 - When I brought up how awful their service is I was told that “as we work with over 4,000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time” [0.67585874]
719 Will YOU be part of that group [0.92639077]
720 - You have to pay $500 for an “implementation specialist” who will respond (maybe/if they feel like it) days later with no solution to your problem because they are ‘busy with [more important] back to back meetings' (email from Aug 3 2020) [0.99797404]
722 They will do nothing [0.93425816]
723 - “Management” only shows up/is available for a call when you’ve voiced that you’re leaving the company [0.84667236]
724 - Once you speak with “management” you’ll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency [0.98036194]
726 Literally never talk to you again [0.85681313]
728 Still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me [0.8019294]
729 Tom Brady [0.9379862]
731 - Their 5-star reviews are clearly fake [0.8431417]
732 They deleted mine and other negative comments on Instagram and have disabled reviews on Facebook (I reposted my IG comment) [0.8659708]
733 On Trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling 'reviews' right after an authentic negative review [0.9913991]
734 And they’re constantly reporting reviews for ‘breaching guidelines’ Maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldn’t have to spend time making up and disputing reviews [0.89995384]
736 Avoid [0.7869002]
738 *** - Read the real reviews not the bots [0.75760645]
740 - Read the comments that they keep deleting on their social media accounts [0.89760697]
742 - Do not be fooled by reports of growth and investors pouring money into the company [0.49935043]
743 Anyway if you choose to still proceed good luck it will absolutely not end well [0.9875475]
744 ShipBob has been transformational for us [0.9549813]
746 ShipBob helped save our business [0.55135745]
750 ShipBob's onboarding process with Taylor was fantastic and thorough [0.55718774]
755 I have been charged $90 in one warehouse for 38 units and $40 for 64 in another for the same units [0.40081805]
756 If you think that does not make sense you'd be correct [0.9287199]
759 The prices are high and the support is super slow I don't see how they can be nr 1 [0.96504253]
760 Simple problems take a few weeks to be resolved and they don't mind to update you unless you call them (which is another $25 that cost for you) [0.8389525]
762 I hope they will change at some point but at this very moment - don't repeat my mistake choose something different [0.8852477]
764 I have been so impressed with ShipBob [0.95313644]
765 They have taken the time to answer any questions that I have and have made the transition seamless [0.9654885]
767 Brian H [0.98851895]
768 and Dominique R [0.9697425]
769 have been the best to us and we are so happy that we were able to work with them [0.9693088]
770 ShipBob has been a pleasure to work with [0.95445794]
771 We are an agency and systems integrator and shipbob is often brought into the conversation with many of our clients [0.8570041]
772 ShipBob has been a game changer for me [0.9527691]
774 I have a full time job so I really needed to offload this aspect of my business and I am so happy I found ShipBob [0.9941415]
775 The integration into my storefronts was super simple and the implementation team as well as my account manager have been so helpful [0.7618781]
778 We mostly worked with Samantha and shes very responsive and knowledgeable [0.8120468]
780 Overall very pleasant and seemingless experience [0.91446316]
781 We've been using ShipBob since even before we started delivering masks in early 2019 [0.9531179]
782 They have been an essential partner to us [0.9569483]
784 In addition their flexibility in picking a variety of items without significant upcharge has allowed us to adapt quickly to service our customers with a variety of different products and services [0.49250093]
786 I am not disappointed [0.9994639]
790 I have been lied to every step of the way [0.95609504]
797 Now multiply that over hundreds of similar errors and suddenly our bill was out of control within the first two weeks [0.82733756]
798 They've said "we're definitely going to be refunding the difference" but I still haven't seen a dime [0.83747363]
799 They claim that their SLAs got pushed back due to covid but "99% are still fulfilled on time" [0.4284582]
800 I have had may the inverse 1% filled on time [0.99133873]
801 Most are late to be fulfilled late to deliver and often "reset" their SLA with no reason given and nothing you can do to ask "why" [0.98398846]
803 Their glowing reviews are a complete sham and I didn't think I could have a worse experience than I did with my former company; ShipBob proved me wrong [0.9562921]
804 We have been using ShipBob for over a year now [0.9526867]
807 Overall communication is top notch [0.98718756]
808 I would highly recommend [0.996009]
809 Mark was insightful curious and solution-oriented during our entire process from the first call to the go-live date [0.6261842]
810 Have been using ShipBob for about 4 months now and have had a mostly positive experience [0.9559566]
811 Overall the platform is easy to use and the analytics are better than most other 3PLs we've used [0.8656549]
815 made onboarding a breeze [0.55122715]
817 Solved multiple critical fulfilment issues that we were facing [0.90724045]
820 Our rep Mark went above and beyond by working with us to get through unforeseen delays in production and logistics while maintaining our service tier [0.62120026]
821 On-point onboarding process and service [0.6032446]
822 Regular con-calls were scheduled to get us through learning to use the platform effectively [0.972622]
823 Our implementation specialist Samantha went out of her way to schedule early (8am) con-calls to match our timezone that's 13 hours removed from theirs [0.92133844]
825 Their agents were fast to respond communicated effectively and understood the nature of the problem I was experiencing without my having to go into a huge amount of detail Their responses were also timely [0.9975369]
826 Nothing goes according to plan [0.9348608]
829 I tried several times came back and micromanaged the process to get the same result [0.9425844]
830 Never again [0.87211293]
831 I've found ShipBob to be incredible to deal with so far [0.9387091]
832 Our rep Bob LeGere has been so patient while we've natigated our way through manufacturing delays and he never fails to check in on us and make sure we are on track with everything and ready to get the ball rolling as soon as we have our products ready [0.68636215]
833 No question is ever too silly to ask Bob he makes us feel heard and understood [0.9864193]
835 And aside from the stellar personal service we have received the dashboard is so straightforward to use and I can definitely see a long standing relationship between my company and ShipBob [0.68709046]
840 THEY ARE CHARGING ME $700 TO MOVE MY INVENTORY OUT OF THEIR WAREHOUSE [0.89701134]
841 THEY ARE SIMPLY SCAMMERS [0.9753295]
842 INSIDE US SHIPMENTS OF $20 DOLLARS IS ABSURD [0.9418719]
843 * DO NOT WORK WITH THEM* [0.98456144]
847 g [0.8957858]
853 If I could rate zero stars it would not be low enough [0.92646295]
856 Two weeks down and soon is yet to happen [0.986433]
858 Even when you get a response it rarely gives you a way forward [0.8261237]
860 Also don't be fooled by SLAs [0.42429966]
863 The above is happening while ShipBob is declaring new reduced SLAs as things are coming back to normal [0.45675296]
864 If you are looking for a long term partner to support your needs carry one [0.9890792]
865 ShipBob is not the place to stop [0.98613673]
866 Our onboarding/integration manager Dominique Roman is probably the reason we decided to stay with ShipBob [0.9863253]
867 There were ups and downs with onboarding and integrating with ShipBob was not perfectly seamless but that's where a great onboarding/integration manager like Dominique makes all the difference [0.55678296]
868 And now that we've passed the initial growing pains ShipBob has become an invaluable and critical part of our operations and business as a whole [0.95555955]
869 To be honest it would be impossible to scale our business without a 3PL partner like ShipBob or without hiring dozens if not hundreds of people [0.40472558]
870 And thanks to Dom for helping us get through the early issues because we wouldn't be enjoying this beneficial partnership now if it weren't for her tireless efforts to solve complex coding back-end and logistical issues that popped up [0.980667]
875 Definately would recommend this to any business [0.9952776]
877 They pitch themselves as a cheap option but actually they just fleece you at every opportunity - in many cases charging me $40-80 to send a box with 2 baseball caps in it [0.9363681]
879 Shipbob has been extremely helpful since the start [0.95228744]
881 Love working with them [0.95587707]
885 Highly Recommend [0.76822865]
891 While patiently waiting the products went back to their incorrect weights in which I have to wait for their team to correct again [0.7350827]
893 Also the systems don’t integrate so their pick error rate is much higher than in the contract I’ve signed [0.9900111]
896 Their social media leaves no room for reviews for a reason [0.8288858]
897 Best of luck to anyone getting involved [0.9540401]
898 Literally would recommend any other company [0.9935052]
899 I've been using Shipbob for a couple of months only and I wish I hadn't [0.9488264]
903 Storage cost is insane as they use wrong product dimensions [0.9729118]
906 They overpromise and under deliver [0.9954346]
915 RUN AWAY [0.9977388]
916 FEES EVERYWHERE [0.6421172]
918 Ask a few other companies who use (or more likely used to use them) before you use them [0.7506795]
919 Our experience was terrible and I feel cheated [0.9816482]
920 Their SLAs are sneaky and borderline deceitful compared to their sales pitch [0.41143692]
923 They word it as such: "5 business days once the WRO moved to "Arrived" status" Guess who defines "arrived" [0.6158279]
924 That's right - ShipBob [0.7383362]
925 Doesn't matter when it physically arrives they are the ultimate word here [0.7882801]
926 Its all in their writing so I guess I'm to blame but never have I seen a spoken pitch differ so much from whats in a contract [0.91765416]
928 That said dont you dare mess up anything they will charge you for it and fail to properly notify you [0.9159223]
930 Shipbob is a hidden fee company parading as a 3PL [0.47305045]
932 THERES NO NUMBER ON THEIR SITE - or at least I couldn't find one [0.93087023]
934 I left an urgent message saying they need to not send them and got a call back well into the next day [0.6449606]
938 Rating Shipbob a solid 4 [0.95747113]
939 6 stars [0.9440965]
941 Though there are some occasional bumps in the road the team is committed to resolving issues in an appropriate amount of time and with urgency [0.98576343]
942 They act with integrity and work with you as a true partner [0.9917062]

962 In the last few months many of our clients have lost access to their warehouses and so have had to pivot quickly [0.66966206]

996 Seamless start-to-finish and in the world of logistics that's the only way it can be [0.60445005]
997 We chose ShipBob to manage merchandise for a national touring Grammy-winning artist that sells products of all kinds all over the country and their systems and FC's made our lives so much easier from managing it all in-house [0.66857773]
999 10 recommend [0.9960086]
1000 We have been working with Shipbob for over a year now and have been extremely happy with their services [0.62694705]

1051 Really fast response time and always happy to help [0.81738377]

1060 Our onboarding specialist (Samantha) has been extremely informative and responsive [0.57503366]
1061 The ShipBob portal is very intuitive (much easier than our last 3PL) which has made it easy for our logistics and support team to make the transition [0.7063549]
1062 The process of on-boarding and setting up our business with ShipBob has been made easy and painless by the helpful team members who answer every question we may have with patience and professionalism [0.9309144]

1066 Provides great fulfillment service and great customer service [0.99059296]
1067 Their communication with partners is flawless [0.9228425]
1068 During COVID times and other times we (partners) are always communicated about updates changes and such [0.47507742]
1069 Throughout the time working with them we've had a few issues that come naturally logistics but all have concluded positively [0.5270551]
1070 ShipBob has been professional and helpful the entire way through [0.9517515]
1071 Happy to be working with them [0.9265012]
1072 Made it so easy to get going - thank you Dominique - and super intuitive to use [0.64250654]
1073 ShipBob are SCAMMERS [0.98287934]
1080 They are SCAMMERS and I do not have any other word to describe their acts [0.9873273]
1082 They are a great partner for small businesses and start ups [0.95880646]
1083 They respond quickly and have very affordable options [0.9985271]
1085 Definitely going to continue working with them [0.94423306]
1091 Through it all we felt more like we had a partner with ShipBob [0.9568506]
1092 Very professional company [0.41831636]
1095 ShipBob has exceeded all my expectations and has been excellent to work with from day one [0.93731636]
1098 If you're looking to free up time to focus on other aspects of your business reduce overhead costs and eliminate headaches you should go with ShipBob [0.5288865]
1100 that ShipBob has to offer [0.97147113]
1101 Go with Bob [0.63718414]
1102 you won't regret it [0.94315845]
1103 We have been using Shipbob for multiple months now for two seperate companies we own [0.8542676]
1105 we recommend Shipbob to any D2C brand - super convenient affordable and helpful [0.96745837]
1107 -- Professional friendly and quickly responsive to questions and concerns [0.83242875]
1108 Love working with the ShipBob team [0.9585731]
1109 Great services [0.59241366]
1110 We recommend them with confidence [0.99600905]
1112 Great services [0.59241366]
1113 We recommend them with confidence [0.99600905]
1114 Great company [0.41827843]
1115 They went above and beyond to earn our business [0.5605354]
1116 The shipbob team has been amazing since the beginning [0.9525767]
1117 Their onboarding was pretty straightforward and they trained my supply chain staff which was a huge help [0.5625068]
1120 ShipBob is one of the most trustworthy companies I have ever worked with [0.9841174]
1121 Even in these uncertain times ShipBob's communication structure and reliability have helped numerous merchants and myself alike [0.85208815]
1123 As well their insightful set up enables speed and cost savings [0.71210283]
1126 While most of us work from the comfort of our homes their warehouses continue to operate processing all orders for timely delivery [0.8472883]
1128 I would highly recommend using ShipBob  [0.99600756]
1129 AMAZING PARTNERSHIP [0.9857712]
1130 I am so thankful for ShipBob to be open during this pandemic [0.9982297]
1133 So glad I chose them over other players in the market [0.6410236]
1140 Warehouse logistics are a mess [0.5571037]
1148 3) They are very consistent in selling this service as we literally get pushed with calls before we actually pay for set-up but when we told that we want to go they do not even bother to ask what's wrong [0.49120376]
1151 In our experience [0.91450584]
1152 They lied about their rates and technological capabilities [0.710091]
1153 They fought with us when we brought issues to their attention [0.8417759]
1156 We had significant issues with ShipBob since we very first began working with them and every time one issue was solved another occurred [0.9812695]
1157 Below are the issues we encountered and based on other reviews and of their own admission I know we are not the only company to face issues like these [0.52317595]
1162 Our product fit in smaller standard boxes they already had in stock [0.65038574]
1163 It was never explained why they made those changes [0.9824934]
1166 I have no idea what happened to our inventory or whether they notified these other companies of this issue [0.7873755]
1167 - It took them 6 weeks to process returns and that is not an exaggeration [0.98737425]
1168 Meaning if an item is returned to the FC they notified us 6 weeks later that it was returned [0.8601636]
1169 Apparently they only decided to put a returns policy in place in Mid-March of this year 6 years after opening their doors as a company [0.45090467]
1173 These exercises took hours and involved a lot of back-and-forth each time [0.9951371]
1179 95 and weighs 6 ounces) [0.9214193]
1180 Our conversion rate plummeted from 4 [0.81155133]
1181 6% to 1 [0.9189683]
1185 When we expressed our desire to leave their SVP of something set up a call presumably to try and retain us but then she missed our call and didn't reschedule [0.7291953]
1186 Shipbob is very responsive whenever I send questions or ask for support [0.9257777]
1187 Their rates are reasonable [0.97569907]
1190 I would recommend them [0.99600905]
1191 They work incredibly well with our core tech stack which is centered around Shopify [0.97980356]
1193 I can assure you it was not and encourage anyone to not make the same costly and headache-inducing mistake [0.968535]
1194 Start with ShipBob and stay with ShipBob [0.9157503]
1196 We've used Shipbob for over a year now and they're the best of the best in the industry [0.86630094]
1200 If you're looking for a solid 3PL partner I highly recommend Shipbob [0.4031949]
1201 I'm very happy with my experience with ShipBob thus far [0.914461]
1202 They make everything super easy and seamless [0.9821994]
1204 I would 100% recommend them to anyone looking for a 3PL provider [0.8785225]
1209 By the time we found problems it was too late to get things corrected without losing two weeks [0.94769704]
1212 Boy was that nice [0.98238665]
1214 We made some additional tweaks with that data in hand and never looked back [0.81983083]
1215 ShipBob worked through all our concerns quickly and never made us feel we were asking too much [0.95888054]
1217 ShipBob is fantastic [0.9864283]
1218 I am just starting out in e-commerce but they have a very user-friendly dashboard and if I do happen to need help with anything reaching out to their support team is easy [0.9900563]
1219 They are always quick to respond and are very helpful [0.9985293]
1220 I highly recommend them [0.99600905]
1221 I love this crew Tom and Mike have been such a huge help for getting us ready for launch [0.9187527]
1227 In all fairness they do have a list of costs based on dimensions and weights but it's just not a practical thing [0.44459614]
1228 They should display costs beforehand on the site [0.5304912]
1229 That's my one major gripe [0.5807507]
1230 Overall they've been a good partner and would recommend them to small business and startups [0.9955373]
1232 However shipbob is a startup and it really feels like that [0.98625755]
1233 The software is slick but do not be fooled [0.97055644]
1236 If there is any issue with billing they will open an "investigation" and never get back to you [0.97173315]
1238 Its fine and seamless until you find out how they are screwing you [0.98183334]
1241 Absolutely horrible [0.6016796]
1245 If I could give them -1 star I would [0.6662151]
1246 Only been using them for a month so far but amazing job so far [0.94289654]
1247 I've worked with Dominique and Erik in the Chicago office and they have been extremely responsive and have made sure that the set-up process has been smooth with mutliple calls and check-ins [0.91224504]
1249 ShipBob has always been very attentive to our needs and has enabled us to grow our business almost 10 fold in the last 18 months [0.93270373]
1251 A great partner [0.95599204]
1252 So my first review was removed by the request of shipBob I have sent supporting evidence to the compliance team at Trust Pilot to prove the issues I have experienced with shipBob are legitamate to enable my original post to be reinstated [0.76788646]
1253 It seems that ShipBob like to remove negative reviews of their company [0.4829374]
1260 They are happy to charge me upwards of $800+ a month but do not have a facility that offers your own person account manager that can help [0.6588453]
1261 Sustandard at best [0.46459213]
1263 I would advise anyone considering them to look elsewhere [0.947844]
1265 g [0.8957858]
1268 I’ve been with shipbob since they started [0.9530872]
1269 They simply grew too fast for their own good [0.8553332]
1272 Last summer is where I started to lose it literally and figuratively [0.9864261]
1275 I was actually on a 3 week camping trip during most of this time and it was very stressful instead of being relaxing [0.980991]
1276 One of my most popular products has been "misplaced" or flat out stolen from their warehouses [0.6858144]
1277 In this coronavirus day and age of lockdown it's an exercise from home trainer [0.9895612]
1279 The person who signed for it "no longer works there" All of a sudden in early March I got an out of stock notice and had sold 50 since Jan [0.6632386]
1282 I implored both support and the higher up manager [0.98317295]
1286 To top it off what would've been at least 2-3 months of high demand item is now out of stock for 4-5 weeks because that's how long it takes for new ones to be produced [0.5169958]
1291 So after that I noticed the new "policy" not to reimburse for shipping YOU paid for when shipbob clearly wraps up your product charges you for it and someone steals it or throws it in the garbage [0.6909837]
1292 If I could rate them -100 stars I would [0.5926135]
1293 Dominique was my implementation engineer and she did a fantastic job every step of the way [0.9649179]
1298 I feel like this is my warehouse without actually having to hire staff purchase a building manage or support of actually operating my own warehouse [0.53349686]
1299 Keep this up [0.44897136]
1300 I've waited before reviewing ShipBob as I think it's a great concept but the last experience with them has really drawn the line [0.9178568]
1309 (This is a 4h driver from the warehouse) [0.98528475]
1311 63 for it [0.72472894]
1315 Note that Berlin to Spain is a 24h drive [0.9752427]
1316 But the reason why I am now writing this review is that we just had our first return [0.9957496]
1320 In our own warehouses in Europe we have a flat return rate of 8€ small/medium items and 12€ for larger items and I am sure that it's the same in the US and am fairly convinced that it's even cheaper as everything stays in the same country [0.49823913]
1322 I really didn't want to write this review this is completely absurd [0.991133]
1326 Or try to send the same 20"x20"x20" parcel from Texas to NY including a return label and try to justify the $231,5 charge [0.91212344]
1327 Update: I thought it would be very interesting to add the following: Our offices are located in Berlin Germany and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices [0.6268535]
1330 New update: This keeps on getting better [0.5920315]
1332 (Shipping cost from Texas to NY: $140) their response to this is that Shipbob "does not take any responsibility for the damages" [0.97418606]
1333 WHAT [0.80298126]
1334 For $140 there is no insurance included [0.97068495]
1335 And Shipbob does not take any responsibility for damages [0.7062454]
1336 This means that we now need to return this lamp to Shipbob for which they will charge us another $90 [0.49287567]
1337 This is just the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with and I am looking forward to our stock being over with them [0.8867867]
1338 Shipbob also claims to be a US company but only has support overseas [0.5401082]
1341 We requested to raise a complaint and they said they are happy not to accept our complaint investigation [0.955765]
1345 I sell supplements and sell in US and Asia [0.76892]
1346 When the virus outbreak hit I had to take all my stock out of the US warehouse as we were out of stock in Asia [0.47337493]
1347 Shipbob was a big mess [0.9824528]
1348 Slow & disorganised [0.7744704]
1353 and it's now almost March 2020 [0.535503]
1354 Only the technical engineer who set up the dashboard for me ( which I paid extra money for ) was good and responsive [0.5332634]
1355 But if you want to have access to your own goods then DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY [0.75405014]
1357 Love Shipbob [0.955449]
1358 It's been so easy to work with the team and use the platform [0.95966697]
1359 Highly recommend [0.9960086]
1360 Ive been using FBA USA for over 3 years with a successful product [0.9374145]
1362 I searched high and low to find a company that could meet my needs of fulfilment [0.5771155]
1363 Boom- I found it- ShipBob [0.91711897]
1364 Now having used ShipBob for 3 months I can honestly say that they are simply incredible [0.9828351]
1366 The people of ShipBob are one of its greatest assets [0.5653414]
1367 Secondly the platform is so easy to use [0.98695415]
1368 You'll find it much easier than FBA if you've ever used that platform [0.9433079]
1369 In short I highly recommend using ShipBob for your physical or digital product fulfilment needs [0.9952514]
1370 Best regards [0.6651411]
1371 Shipbob has been great from A - Z [0.94896007]
1373 It has been smooth sailing since and we are totally satisfied with their service [0.424418]
1375 Kevin and Tom are both quick to help and find solutions for any issues which there are very few of [0.9776389]
1376 They are both very knowledgable about the system and generally proactive [0.5968797]
1377 I highly recommend this company [0.98707014]
1378 The Ship Bob team has been incredibly helpful and a pleasure to work with [0.9375307]
1381 Aaron Hodes my account manager is incredibly knowledgeable and always eager to find solutions to my issue [0.9223702]
1382 Things are running smooth as a dream and I couldn't be happier [0.94400024]
1383 I can only say great things about Shipbob [0.7901452]
1385 and the process could not have been smoother [0.9452339]
1386 My first contact was with Terry in Biz dev and he really was very patient explaining everything their service offered and organizing a demo so whow what could be done remotely which was key for me [0.63326]
1389 ShipBob is a great 3pl solution [0.98299307]
1390 They help you set everything up and then it works like a swiss watch [0.95412433]
1391 Highly recommended [0.9488471]
1396 Smooth and expedient on-boarding to get up and running quickly and scale [0.9236126]
1397 ShipBob has an incredibly friendly and helpful team of people committed to helping small business owners flourish [0.66670406]
1400 Great support Team the warehouse took their time to explain the process and implementation team is impeccable whenever there's n issue they're very responsive and are always happy to help [0.93141884]
1401 Shipbob has been a great partner for our business [0.90554196]
1403 Very easy to manage and integrate with our website [0.98380136]
1404 We plan to grow our business with Shipbob in the coming year [0.9442904]
1406 It's been a pleasure working with Kevin [0.9534748]
1407 We truly feel he is a partner and genuinely cares about our business [0.9832878]
1408 The onboarding team has been very helpful as we ramp things up [0.6032675]
1411 stay tuned [0.9288883]
1413 In the beginning I was using them out of necessity because I had a full time job and a side business [0.90873045]
1414 This allowed me to spend my evenings growing my business [0.7372437]
1415 I now do my business full time and kept using ShipBob just because it's one less thing to worry about [0.55388874]
1418 If they make a mistake they own it and fix it quick [0.923309]
1422 Ralph Thomas Owner Sketch Wallet [0.78157026]
1423 Genaro is great and handles our account well [0.820605]
1424 His ability to resolve issues and help with support is appreciated [0.9873405]
1425 The response time from support is slow especially when you are new to ShipBob so this is my only complaint with service so far and I think it could be resolved if the account had 1 main point of contact that they could contact at any point in time to answer any issues [0.6394673]
1426 That could be made short time at least until the account holder has all important issues resolved [0.43126312]
1427 Still surreal how easy it is to onboard and setup with ShipBob [0.98633736]
1429 Our onboarding engineer was knowledgeable and fast [0.55251515]
1435 I work with Eshaan Shipton and Aaron and they make time available at any point during the day to help me [0.93645877]
1436 They are fantastic partners and I love working with them [0.9833558]
1437 Would highly recommend :) Justin [0.99580127]
1438 Incredible support and communication [0.8555234]
1439 the team at Shipbob made it very easy to get started without feeling overwhelmed [0.89637715]
1440 Highly recommend [0.9960086]
1441 ShipBob has single-handedly empowered my solopreneur venture and helped me scale beyond what I could possibly do on my own [0.9879137]
1443 I'd contribute most of my 5x growth over the past year to outsourcing to ShipBob [0.9618752]
1444 Logistics is never without headaches and I've certainly experienced some but ShipBob always corrects course and makes up for it [0.9608826]
1447 It allows us to focus on activities like marketing to help us scale the business [0.74922705]
1451 If we ran our own warehouse it would be much harder to hire people and we’d inevitably outgrow the space [0.88856536]
1452 Having a helpful dedicated account manager at ShipBob that we can go to who responds quickly and has a good understanding of our products and company is really important to us [0.86888134]
1454 Shipbob is great for companies getting off the ground [0.97990495]
1458 We have not encountered any issues with ShipBob [0.8539153]
1459 The dashboard is intuitive and notifies you of any discrepancies (e [0.69644547]
1460 g [0.8957858]
1462 They also notify you of changing rates in accordance to fair market pricing [0.9157471]
1463 Essentially they are transparent about their practices and our products get delivered within the timeframe promised [0.78332126]
1464 We have had such an incredible experience with ShipBob over the last few months [0.91381484]
1476 ShipBob has not failed for us yet [0.91325814]
1477 So it's a fantastic offensive line [0.9562702]
1479 Ease of use: 10/10 - the shipbob online interface is super easy to use [0.7669106]
1480 The team is also super responsive to any issues [0.9776117]
1483 When we told them what we were currently paying they lost interest pretty quickly [0.7323636]
1484 Shipbob is an awesome warehousing & distribution service that is always improving [0.55965346]
1486 I only foresee things getting better going forward [0.9989096]
1487 Compliments on the process [0.9421235]
1489 Implementation went smoothly communication was very good and the products were drop-shipped on time as promised from the beginning [0.8531781]
1490 The process was followed [0.961175]
1491 We knew what we could expect and they delivered [0.6791369]
1492 The ShipBob team is exceedingly helpful kind and very responsive [0.9822651]
1494 It is very important for our growing businesses to have experts to depend on and that is exactly what we have found in our partnership with ShipBob [0.98668516]
1495 I had used Shipbob for 3 years and suffered far too long [0.96951216]
1503 This happened as often as not [0.9534936]
1504 The web-interface is clunky and buggy [0.9761551]
1505 Only just now has a "merchant care" telephone number been setup [0.9263342]
1506 It's hit or miss as to whether someone answers [0.9653426]
1509 " And then there is this doozy - Overcharging $1400 yes [0.8561895]
1513 You don't keep 'my' money ahead of time [0.851511]
1517 "We'll look into this and get onto it as soon as possible" - still 2-3 weeks later and NOT [0.88644403]
1518 ONE [0.69076294]
1520 This will have to be resolved through local police fraud department I believe [0.8983704]
1522 Happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so [0.4504587]
1529 Away [0.6511918]
1530 Shipbob simply are THAT bad [0.98322195]
1531 UPDATE: It appears that any negative review of Shipbob is attempted to be taken down off Trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine [0.9878757]
1532 Trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with Shipbob [0.56526953]
1535 I felt it necessary to warn others [0.8102562]
1537 ” Now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5-star reviews show “verified customer” [0.6385775]
1538 It Could well be a case of fake 5-star reviews being uploaded [0.93552476]
1539 Trustpilot you should require ALL REVIEWERS to be verified [0.6551992]
1541 They are VERY QUICK to ask you for a review and “tell us how we’re doing” Well I am telling you how you’re doing [0.99603504]
1542 DISGRACEFUL [0.6240483]
1543 That said I hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using Shipbob [0.98254144]
1544 I Will Never Recommend Shipbob [0.76822865]
1548 They charged me 500 USD extra [0.8834494]
1549 I do not recommend these guys at all [0.99600905]
1550 AVOID this company [0.41832045]
1553 The "support" team is pathetically incompetent and clueless [0.9862961]
1554 I'll share just TWO of many horrible experiences [0.8960007]
1558 I don't know how but they literally sent the order to the address "DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP" [0.86504865]
1562 Yet Shipbob provided zero compensation to us for their mistake [0.6617258]
1563 2) Recently I noticed charges on my credit card statement from Shipbob for $75 day-after-day going back for months [0.959532]
1565 ) for storage on their dock because I didn't create a Warehouse Receiving Order for the items [0.48537582]
1569 Insane [0.9530712]
1576 I'd rather spend my time growing my own business than wasting countless hours with your useless support team [0.65816945]
1578 It's so utterly frustrating sometimes I feel as if I'm going to have a heart attack [0.9991551]
1579 I hate to disparage anyone's business but you doing us a great disservice [0.5530521]
1580 Shipbob is ruining a small business we've been working on for 13 years [0.984346]
1582 We thought moving to Shipbob from Rakutensl (formerly Webgistix) was going to save us some money [0.96440077]
1584 I've talked to the Shipbob leadership a few times about my issues but there was no improvement [0.98360914]
1585 Clearly they doesn't know how to create a great company [0.4187282]
1586 1 in 5 Trustpilot reviewers give Shipbob the lowest possible score [0.89334255]
1587 Save yourself the trouble and avoid these amateurs [0.8215645]
1588 PS: It appears Shipbob reports every 1-star review on Trustpilot as bogus in an attempt to get them removed [0.9807641]
1589 So their real Trustpilot rating is probably worst than it appears here [0.9862094]
1595 This was not an issue with our previous provider [0.9035295]
1596 ShipBob has been a parter of our for almost a year now and they have been nothing but supportive and helpful when it comes to educating us on their product and offerings [0.9137062]
1597 We work very closely with their team on a lot of marketing and client collaborations and the experience is great every time [0.97683513]
1598 Really excited to see what lies ahead for them [0.7847002]
1599 Horrible Experience We have had a terrible experience working with ShipBob and would encourage other companies to avoid using them at all costs even if it means paying more for storage/fulfillment [0.6580531]
1604 It is clear that there huge holes in their operations and procedures and that despite months of problems issues continue to occur [0.963541]
1606 It is not worth the hassle and headache that your business will incur [0.9185093]
1609 There was a learning curve for both (us) and ShipBob at the beginning but once expectations were established I think we have become great partners [0.9851983]
1611 This is a major plus for any business using multiple warehouses [0.76740277]
1613 Because of [NAME REDACTED BECAUSE OF SHIPBOB COMPLAINT] we will NEVER use shipbob again [0.9794772]
1614 I run a Shopify powered e-commerce site to create and sell nutrition bars [0.7655025]
1617 Shipbob has introduced a new analytics tool that allows you to get proactive and manage your customer's expectations [0.61312]
1620 So why is this important [0.9864283]
1622 Shipbob's founder Dhruv Saxena is pretty engaged and reached out to me when I was having trouble [0.97428036]
1623 He helped me sort out my issues successfully [0.8416522]
1624 PROS: 1 [0.9202475]
1625 Very easy to use 2 [0.9867163]
1626 Robust 3 [0.9419638]
1628 Integrates flawlessly with my e-commerce site on Shopify platform 5 [0.9853246]
1629 Cool analytical features 6 [0.7315582]
1632 Affordable if you are already established or have consistent predictable order flow [0.9784248]
1633 ShipBob is an amazing partner of ours here at BigCommerce [0.40587842]
1635 So happy to have them as a part of our partner program [0.95339715]
1636 ShipBob has a fantastic team that we work with [0.9687899]
1637 They are always extremely friendly flexible and talented [0.98326]
1638 We love being a ShipBob partner here at ShipStation [0.95547026]
1642  2day programs order tag mapping) and their account management process based on merchant feedback [0.9030055]
1646 We've worked with Pete who is very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the process [0.9878083]
1648 Definitely worth the (very reasonable) financial investment [0.6912676]
1649 We have used Shipbob for a few years now [0.4907264]
1651 We recently had an issue with misshaped product which happens [0.76442194]
1653 This is Five Star service [0.4542086]
1655 This review is been long overdue and you should probably read this review to the end if you're considering doing business with ShipBob [0.98483753]
1658 The decision to switch to ShipBob from a previous fulfillment provider was executed after extensive research at the time as we've tried a couple different 3PL partners in the past that only led to issues [0.42675635]
1660 Their web interface is super friendly and easy to use and their API integrates flawlessly with our shopify store [0.973404]
1663 After numerous attempts to understand what was happening and trying to find a fast resolution it took some time to get clarity on the situation as we finally learned that they invested in newer tools and introduced state of the art scanning and weighing technology (similar to amazon robots) which should've been a "Pro" but it wasn't in beginning as there was apparently a learning curve to this new technology [0.795908]
1664 So let me give you a bit more context on what exactly was happening and what that scanning technology was supposed to do [0.98169845]
1667 Sounds good right [0.9953809]
1668 we thought so too [0.48767555]
1675 This understanding of the issue came a bit late aftersome frustration and almost having to walk away from ShipBob altogether (Im So Glad We Did Not) as Dhruv "Co-Founders of ShipBob" reached out to us personally in his attempt to help us understand the situation and change our recent experience and I must admit that I was blown away by his level of dedication courtesy and professionalism along with his team to get us back on track and rebuild our trust and confidence level once again [0.94247395]
1676 Dhruv worked tirelessly and seemed to have our best interest at heart (which is extremely rare to find these days) not once has he denied the issue or tried to sugarcoat it he knew what was wrong took the time to explain it to us and quickly executed a recovery plan to get back on track [0.9853514]
1679 An honorable and a big move on his end in my opinion that many choose to look the other way and neglect [0.96507454]
1680 In my 18+ years of entrepreneurship and the number of entities I was a part of building establishing and operating I haven't seen many like him which not only resulted in fixing our problems it also gave us the confidence that we were in good hands moving forward [0.9758701]
1681 Because by the end of the day nothing and no one is perfect and issues as well as mishaps do rise and come up in every business model it's part of growing and as a private brand we ourselves had our own fair share of trials and errors and that's how we all learn and evolve [0.97420156]
1682 The most important part is learning from the mistakes and working hard on recovering from them and Dhruv as a the face of the company truly demonstrated his abilities of caring and recovering from any issue no matter how messy it can be [0.9279475]
1683 He also put his team on our account "Voluntarily" to perform a full audit and was happy to compensate us for any overcharges that occured during that period Its now been over 3 months since this issue was resolved and everything seems to be moving like clockwork [0.44234812]
1686 as they're now stronger than ever and will most definitely benefit your business now that they have every smart tool in the shed sharpened and ready to go in your favor while saving you time and money [0.6208991]
1692 We have been using shipbob for about year and a half now [0.9524836]
1693 Our experience has been great and we've been delighted to grow with them [0.9607585]
1694 Their seamless integration with shopify is what makes them stand far above many other 3PL's [0.8981889]
1697 Shipbob has always been there to provide us with assistance which has been a huge help [0.9888927]
1699 Hopefully they will expand soon [0.9554585]
1702 Since then it's been smooth sailing [0.9530005]
1704 Love how easy the platform is to use and how fast I can get help whenever I have questions [0.9864141]
1705 Great company to work with  [0.4461757]
1707 ShipBob product offerings are the best in the industry [0.8313682]
1708 I am glad to be with ShipBob [0.99914914]
1709 I trust the team and trust the company [0.42256528]
1710 Forceshave & Skin Care [0.77898175]
1713 They have certainly helped us expand our company’s reach and taken a load off of our shoulders [0.96010596]
1714 Their backend system has been very helpful and relatively easy to use [0.9461102]
1715 And their support staff are VERY quick to respond with assistance in the event that we need anything answered or dealt with [0.9972724]
1716 Would highly recommend to any sized business that is looking for a 3rd party logistics partner [0.82263345]
1722 I've had nothing but good interactions with the ShipBob help folks and their management team [0.7276126]
1723 I highly recommend them and would happily recommend them to anybody who is running an online business and wants to experience more sustainability freedom and success [0.99437594]
1725 The are friendly helpful and go the extra mile to make sure we have what we need [0.9844136]
1728 Accuracy and timing are the most important to us and ShipBob helps us execute on that [0.9898834]
1733 I cannot imagine trying to run a successful e-commerce company without a strong logistics partner [0.4669861]
1735 The best thing to know is that if my company were to grow by ten times in a short period Shipbob would be able to handle the growth without skipping a beat [0.91319793]
1739 was quite many mistakes but eventually Jenny Gittleson helped with all of them [0.9824751]
1741 You will be lied to a lot [0.92543924]
1744 Do not pay a company to try and get lucky [0.8636096]
1747 I had to tell them how to do their job several times [0.76482403]
1748 Many better options out there [0.7844004]
1749 Do not use this company [0.41987252]
1752 There was no way to do this [0.98246825]
1759 I haven't received a response [0.82280546]
1760 This company is a joke [0.5911476]
1761 Do not deal with them [0.9764993]
1764 This is outrageous considering my original complaint was that they abused the data I provided when I signed up [0.8820323]
1765 These people continue to be a joke [0.92669415]
1766 DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY BUSINESS [0.98570913]
1767 ANOTHER UPDATE: Shipbob reported my review for being false as they have done with several other one-star reviews [0.976223]
1769 These people will do whatever it takes to get bad reviews off this site [0.5362193]
1771 PROSPECTIVE BUYERS TAKE NOTE: Shipbob's recent 5-star reviews which suddenly took them from a one-star to four-star company are suspect: They are vague unverified and lack detail - classic hallmarks of fakery [0.5837831]
1773 Trustpilot should be monitoring this [0.94884723]
1774 YET ANOTHER UPDATE: Shipbob despite my review being verified by Trustpilot as true reported my review [0.92808783]
1780 I am updating this review because Matt & Tom have worked tremendously hard to fix my issues [0.9936118]
1781 Shipbob and their system get around 3 [0.8398252]
1782 5 stars and Matt & Tom get 5 stars for their hard work and patient [0.9432455]
1788 If they manage to get around these two issues they would be perfect [0.9267731]
1790 If you don't want to go out of business don't work with them [0.57129383]
1793 They happily charge you $32 for a 2 lb [0.5120429]
1795 Once you complaint about it they will say "sorry we are looking into it" and that's it [0.8809571]
1796 You will never heard from them again or get an answer when you follow up [0.9653784]
1799 Takes anywhere 2-3 days [0.9977022]
1802 It's unbelievable how are they still in business, [0.98322487]
1806 As a small business owner this could have been devastating and I am sure we are not the only ones that have had this experience [0.9951134]
1807 I would not recommend them at all [0.99600905]
1808 EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING & COSTLY FOR YOUR BUSINESS We've been working with Shipbob for 7 months now and has been the worst experience we've ever had with a fulfilment centre [0.95448565]
1809 1 [0.9202871]
1812 Utterly frustrating [0.7736253]
1813 2 [0.9394844]
1814 They refuse to admit fault and compensate for any errors they make [0.88241905]
1816 Save yourself and your business the money time spare your bad reputation and go somewhere else [0.5607495]
1817 Shipbob is an excellent company [0.74760145]
1818 Very on the ball smart and responsive [0.8161242]
1820 Love it [0.9554649]
1828 they go out of their way to help the little guys and I wouldn’t go anywhere else [0.89379346]
1830 We couldn't do it without then [0.8166701]
1832 ShipBob is going great job: on time and responsible [0.985759]
1836 Highly recommend for any new startup that needs logistics help [0.6471545]
1837 Had a good overall experience working with Shipmonk [0.9149332]
1838 Dashboard was easy to use and seemed simple [0.40199623]
1841 They were not [0.93287706]
1842 We integrated our WooCommerce store to ShipMonk with the help of their support and integration teams [0.7394517]
1843 Their support was personal fast and effective [0.98702973]
1847 She goes the extra step to find a solution and if she does not know she will reach out to others to find the answer [0.9577197]
1850 Lissa Halo Beauty [0.5474996]
1851 This company is terrible [0.9364464]
1852 I was a client with Shipmonk for 2 years and here are just a FEW of the mishaps I had to deal with [0.9670456]
1853 1 [0.9202871]
1856 2 [0.9394844]
1857 Special Projects go ignored [0.87091696]
1859 It went untouched for 2 MONTHS [0.9426455]
1860 When I asked about the status they ignored me and marked it as Resolved [0.70535094]
1861 3 [0.94197536]
1864 It went untouched for 10 DAYS until I followed up with them [0.9148243]
1871 (Most 3PLs charge $10/pallet [0.7417285]
1872 ) 4 [0.9418758]
1876 I filed a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back [0.46241796]
1878 Then Shipmonk RE-BILLED ME for the exact same amount [0.44683555]
1879 Now they have DOUBLE the money they were never supposed to bill me for in the first place [0.48983857]
1882 They also charged me $13 [0.92731315]
1884 (Most 3PLs charge $5 a carton [0.66488653]
1885 ) 5 [0.8564253]
1888 6 [0.9440967]
1892 7 [0.9683504]
1894 They do not respond [0.9985299]
1896 8 [0.9347674]
1897 They "lost" 20 cartons of my product and refused to reimburse me for the product cost or the supposed storage fees I was paying on it [0.7476157]
1898 9 [0.99053365]
1899 Closing my account was a headache and the process took over 5 weeks [0.5574868]
1900 TWICE they said they would credit my account if I signed their Closing Agreement which had a very detailed non-disparagement clause meaning I could not say or post anything negative about them [0.58912146]
1901 Obviously they were aware I was upset with their services and were trying to shut me up [0.59313226]
1903 I flat out said NO I am not signing this [0.99946374]
1905 AGAIN they said they would credit me the $250 if I sign their non-disparagement agreement [0.9446919]
1906 I said NO again and threatened to hire an attorney and pursue legal action if they didn't close my account immediately [0.84576577]
1907 That seemed to do the trick and I am finally done with these clowns [0.99946356]
1908 Working with Shipmonk has been the worst decision I ever made for my business [0.9134611]
1910 They NEVER take responsibility for mistakes it’s always YOUR FAULT [0.97896194]
1912 I do not recommend Shipmonk to anybody who is serious about their e-commerce business or their sanity [0.99586713]
1918 I was immediately disappointed [0.9773179]
1920 I will give credit to their support team for always trying to sort through issues and correct them [0.9842419]
1921 Though i have gone though periods where it has been weeks before getting a response [0.9375533]
1922 I have not tried other companies yet but if I could I would turn back time and gone another way [0.6472575]
1923 I do not recommend them [0.99600905]
1924 Fantastic company for fulfilment from start to finish they have been a pleasure to work with [0.6188712]
1927 I am still in a very difficult situation but the Support Team has been amazing with a focus on the future rather than on the short term difficulties [0.9972123]
1928 They have gained my trust and respect through their actions and I look forward to a bright future with them [0.97541463]
1929 THIS COMPANY IS A BUNCH OF CROOKS OMG WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN [0.98681116]
1930 THANK YOU FOR NEARLY PUTTING MY BUSINESS OUT OF BUSINESS [0.984659]
1931 LOSING INVENTORY LETTING INVENTORY SIT FOR AGES OVERCHARGING DODGY PRICING THAT THEY CHANGE ALL OF THE TIME WHERE EVEN WHEN INVENTORY WOULD GO DOWN MY PRICE WOULD GO UP CUZ "IT HAD TO BE MOVED" UMMM NOT MY PROBLEM [0.8142248]
1932 DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME [0.9943581]
1933 GO TO JMF IF YOU ARE IN SOUTH FLORIDA [0.7842014]
1934 They are the worst [0.9832251]
1935 I can't think of a thing they did right [0.7841982]
1936 It was a full time job managing them [0.97920287]
1937 They lost product mishipped product and were never able to sort out all the issues before we left [0.7289736]
1939 I think that's called stealing [0.6857004]
1940 If you want to go out of business use SHIPMONK [0.64227533]
1941 They do that for free [0.8163141]
1942 Dear ALL please do not use this Company service it's absolutely terrible service I have ever received [0.40611714]
1946 I do have all the proof and evedience [0.8141989]
1949 There are so many better options out there and the biggest regret ever is that I used ShipMonk for the past 18 months [0.9841968]
1953 SHIPPING PRICES: One of the main reasons you use a good 3PL is to have the ability to take advantage of their cheaper / negotiated rates [0.40775073]
1954 Not the case here [0.5138302]
1957 They are charging you as much as possible to just provide more profits for them truly not caring for these small businesses they are providing services for [0.6238986]
1958 2 DAY SHIPPING [0.728074]
1962 there were MANY cases where I would pay for their "custom label fee" which is $5 provide my own label via ShipStation and it would STILL be cheaper than the cost they were giving me [0.9848175]
1963 How does that even happen [0.9769452]
1968 You literally have to baby sit and monitor there every move to make sure things are done correctly but no small business has the time for this [0.91431123]
1969 STORAGE COSTS: There storage costs are pretty standard [0.4201186]
1970 but want to know the worst part [0.66648453]
1971 They won't tell you what they are charging for each specific product [0.8008272]
1973 I asked if I could get a report of all my storage costs but they were unable to do so [0.43148723]
1974 Just said 'we don't offer that' [0.97162104]
1975 How are you generating these costs if you can't tell me what the cost is for each product [0.70743155]
1977 You will find cheaper with any other 3pl trust me [0.7973163]
1978 When it came to closing my account I was prepared to file a lawsuit it got so bad and I honestly wish I did [0.40497205]
1979 To 'close out my account and move my inventory' it took a whopping 35 days [0.44494987]
1981 35 DAYS [0.8650209]
1987 Now that you've read this long review stop any communication with them as soon as you can [0.9433154]
1990 Shipmonk seemed like the best one and after working with them for close to a year I'm confident that I've made the right decision [0.84028655]
1992 Overall a good company [0.41828027]
1993 I've used other 3PL solutions in the past and so far ShiMonk has been the best [0.4036199]
1994 They are not perfect in my opinion they have strengths and weaknesses [0.9797097]
1996 You always receive a reply from a happiness engineer really fast and they are very polite and kind people which makes the experience great [0.98714703]
2001 I thought they were happening because it was Q4 near the Holidays but they kept happening when entering January and also February [0.8217699]
2003 Another thing I don't like is the way they charge you for some things like Storage [0.9754772]
2004 It's confusing and not transparent in my opinion [0.88363606]
2005 For example my product is small and is stocked in few units (most of the times less than 1000 units) [0.9576162]
2007 I remember asking about this some time ago but I did not get a satisfactory explanation and I still don't understand why I have to pay for the bigger storage spaces if my product could easily fit in their smaller/cheapest storage unit [0.85228324]
2008 Other than that everything is good [0.98642844]
2009 I would love it if they could solve those points would easily earn a 5 star instead of 4 [0.9074071]
2011 We chose Shipmonk and have had many failed promises [0.49042106]
2013 Delays for special projects miscounts and more [0.9496787]
2014 They promised seamless International EEI docs but have never delivered [0.58579415]
2016 What a fantastic company [0.41828027]
2019 I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this company but my experience has been great so far [0.4774038]
2021 I was forced and blackmailed to delete my first review by their so called “Vice President of happiness” Adam McCow because the company wouldn’t release our products and closeout our account until I removed the Google and TrustPilot review [0.85237104]
2025 This is fully illegal and don’t let them get away with this [0.9861825]
2026 If you are a company that has experienced the same mistreatment by ShipMonk make sure to reach out to an attorney regard this and make sure to sue ShipMonk [0.76477176]
2029 We still haven’t received our products and we will most likely have to write them off as stolen [0.7376389]
2031 Whatever you do make sure to avoid this company do not remove your reviews and make sure to hire legal help [0.85837775]
2032 As an entrepreneur of 15 years I have never worked with such an immoral company [0.42701906]
2033 Earlier posted review: This company almost ruined our ecommerce business [0.46136332]
2034 We are still trying to get our products from their warehouse and they are not releasing them [0.72779864]
2035 I'll be writing a more lengthy review soon but I just wanted to warn consumers to beware and to stay away from this business [0.96621054]
2036 They are not what they say that they are [0.98316985]
2037 They will without any regard ruin everything you have built and they will always have an excuse and blame you or other circumstances [0.8515628]
2040 So you have an understanding the stock could have fit in 8 shoe boxes and when i asked their team for a stock count they just didn't get back to me [0.58977836]
2043 They love to take advantage of small business during a pandemic [0.56249243]
2044 Disgusting [0.92579067]
2045 Horrible company [0.41827843]
2052 The box is lost [0.98153645]
2053 Take responsibility and pay for it [0.79300475]
2054 Absolutely the worst [0.6016808]
2055 The experience with Shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars [0.86893594]
2057 When you file a claim there is no claim# or confirmation they rcvd your claim [0.90382683]
2058 It just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again [0.9476244]
2062 Shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product [0.73364013]
2064 They told us this was set up and for a while it was working [0.98236376]
2068 We even worked with one of their VP's to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok [0.41350657]
2070 If you need to send items to Amazon in a timely matter you can forget about it [0.7525549]
2076 I highly recommend using any other 3PL [0.5035424]
2077 While it's true that all 3PL's will make many mistakes most 3PL's will do the right thing [0.9762658]
2078 Shipmonk clearly has created a business culture where they will do anything to try and avoid taking responsibility for mistakes they made [0.9074879]
2080 where do I start They don't take responsibility for anything [0.97892874]
2083 There is always an excuse for everything and no compensation for the losses [0.84922236]
2084 Avoid if you can [0.78689617]
2087 We found the folks at ShipMonk to be so honest straightforward and willing to assist on a personal level that it was so easy for us to make the decision in choosing them [0.9714235]
2089 We've only had issues after signing up with Shipmonk [0.8338148]
2091 There are new problems every day [0.9831229]
2093 If issues arise it takes over a week to be dealt with and if there is an issue their favorite line to use is "We can do a special project for you for $45/hr" and they don't take responsibility for anything [0.9812665]
2094 If you're a smaller business they don't care about you [0.5413187]
2095 I'm warning you [0.7444998]
2096 Shipmonk looks like sunshine and rainbows on the outside but once you signup it's the complete opposite [0.9649757]
2098 UPDATE: Their happiness engineers are doing their best [0.9812932]
2101 - - - I almost thought our issues were resolved last week but hello to more problems this week [0.9215312]
2108 This should be illegal [0.9255159]
2109 The worst company I have ever come across [0.41831848]
2112 This company is the absolute worst [0.67476934]
2115 They talk a big game but don't back it up all [0.8624222]
2116 If you are an entrepreneur running a small business - I highly suggest you stay away from these guys [0.8878618]
2118 especially a startup that is trying to build their reputation [0.98545694]
2119 Shipmonk has been the biggest headache for me [0.9523585]
2120 I am the founder of my company and have direct interaction with the Shipmonk team and software on a daily basis [0.79379547]
2121 They have lost my product (numerous times) and blame me for it every time [0.7738535]
2122 Never apologizing even once it is found [0.9864272]
2123 They literally LOSE my product [0.7245596]
2124 They charge extreme amounts for a service that is hardly fulfilled [0.4104953]
2125 "Over promise Under deliver" is how I would rate Shipmonk [0.98628527]
2126 They do a great job at selling you on their services and once you move all your inventory and really invest in them they start treating you like you're worth nothing to them [0.66792786]
2128 No apologies just excuses [0.7485719]
2130 " they say [0.79575855]
2131 I never take the time to write reviews but I felt this was absolutely necessary [0.9699494]
2132 I hope you consider ALL OTHER options before partnering with Shipmonk [0.99298686]
2133 Please feel free to call me directly if you'd like a more personal review of this company [0.45051724]
2135 Everyone I've interacted with at ShipMonk has been very professional polite and helpful [0.95232975]
2137 Their technology is also really slick and so far has worked flawlessly with my Shopify store [0.9840918]
2138 They're not the cheapest but based on my research are probably the best value [0.59370315]
2141 Highly recommended [0.9488471]
2143 Works like Swiss clock [0.88277054]
2145 It was a nightmare [0.9824605]
2148 It's just so bad [0.43049866]
2150 We have the assurance that the most important part of our business (deliveries) is going smoothly [0.9844157]
2151 It's plug and play once you're in their system [0.8414863]
2154 When you fulfill an order it takes how many days before a tracking number becomes available [0.98529196]
2155 Sometimes they will post a tracking number but with no result [0.8996226]
2156 One of the most deceitful businesses I have ever dealt with [0.41094908]
2159 DO NOT EVER consider using Shipmonk [0.9948073]
2160 Very professional team software integration with amazon works like a breeze [0.7730303]
2161 They've been so helpful in helping our business grow to the level that it has [0.9542509]
2162 There would've been no way for us to scale as quickly without them [0.9527443]
2164 Highly recommend them [0.99600893]
2165 The interface is quite easy to use along with the graphics [0.9838662]
2166 Also everything is so well organized [0.9864283]
2168 Mario is the man [0.98642415]
2171 5 Stars for Shipmonk [0.85643095]
2172 Shipmonk's interface is very easy to navigate which makes things 100x easier [0.98502284]
2173 I definitely would recommend to those who are on the fence [0.9960015]
2174 have been with Shipmonk two years and they are great [0.9692808]
2175 By far the worse company ever [0.4182821]
2178 I've lost major account/sales cause I've done business based on their empty promises [0.5806178]
2179 Update- Just so you know how shady this company is they reported me to trust pilot as a fake review to try and get my review removed [0.87681735]
2180 I provided all the doc to trust pilot and they reinstated my review [0.98229]
2181 They went thru the trouble of trying to get my review removed instead of actually solving the issues [0.9825558]
2182 I bet their score would be a lot lower if they weren't actively trying to hide bad reviews [0.9496567]
2183 I have always found the 'Happiness Engineers' (this is so not British but I love it [0.98642504]
2184 ) to be really helpful and they have always resolved any issues I have had [0.92643195]
2186 S [0.966818]
2188 Their team is attentive to detail responsive and reliable [0.8981595]
2189 I have worked directly with Cheryl Haynes and Adam Mackow and they provide the true support and happiness they promise [0.99776936]
2195 Highly recommended [0.9488471]
2196 We used their platform for fulfilling our books [0.9138702]
2197 It worked well [0.9776831]
2198 Seamless integration [0.7667962]
2199 You don't have to worry if there is a technical issue [0.9856392]
2200 We were assigned a relationship manager [0.9950609]
2202 No need for continuous follow-ups [0.71617335]
2205 It's in line with industry standards [0.8681803]
2207 You don't have to worry about logistics [0.52676636]
2208 It's been a pleasure for us to work with Shipmonk for a long period of time with much success [0.954506]
2209 There is no doubt that our business growth was possible thanks to Shipmonk's ability to scale while our business and marking scale with accuracy and control all over and less handling with the logistics as Shipmonk does great work [0.6734404]
2210 I started with ShipMonk two years ago and still going strong [0.8909086]
2214 I have been very impressed overall with Shipmonk [0.9531355]
2215 Like any company reality happens especially with all that is going on right now [0.9289311]
2216 However they have been honest and transparent and have worked very well and hard through all of the economic challenges [0.9502328]
2220 Only downside is that there is no direct access to the actual location where your goods are stored so you will be speaking with a very friendly and responsive intermediary which is not ideal [0.7986942]
2222 Despite the above still HIGHLY recommend [0.996009]
2225 We find Shipmonk great it is easy to navigate through + adjust items [0.6667735]
2226 Happiness Engineers are very helpful and attend to us as needed no request to them has gone unnoticed + respond same day if not sooner with an email/phone call [0.99565107]
2228 Other than that we are satisfied with the services provided [0.59281206]
2230 I dont expect them to keep this review up but if I can save 1 business it's worth it [0.91827106]
2231 You remember the fairly young cyclist mr [0.89852417]
2235 After their employees are done stealing your items overcharging storage [0.47450167]
2238 20,000 products [0.7357932]
2239 Pay $34,000 to pick up (20,000- 3,000 stolen x $2) You think thats bad [0.7938116]
2241 How much is your time worth on the phone dealing with "happiness engineers" with no authority to do/fix anything [0.82676584]
2242 Do whatever you can to find a better fulfilment provider,there are tons out there [0.96387035]
2243 Or pick this place and end up like the former pro cyclist that died of a heart attack at 40(rip) [0.6551951]
2246 I believe this is their strength [0.98642856]
2247 When you deal with people who can be trusted and relied on you know you're in good hands [0.9350427]
2248 Apart from that their platform is easy-to-use and intuitive [0.9880039]
2249 I highly recommend this company [0.98707014]
2250 ShipMonk has been super responsive from day one [0.90766174]
2252 Their interface is clean and easy to use as well [0.9664416]
2254 I highly recommend checking out ShipMonk if you're looking for one for your business [0.9956764]
2255 if you like to stay in business [0.5586657]
2256 We have been using Shipmonk for over 2 years [0.9531124]
2260 If I re-do the same order I am still shown $26 [0.9994452]
2263 This is what I got from their support "when storage exceeds $250 [0.978117]
2264 00 your minimum increases to the storage cost" [0.95294774]
2267 Also it is nearly impossible to know what you are paying for when it comes to storage "their system" essentially decides and there is very little visibility as to why you are paying of X number of pallets or Y number of bins [0.60790837]
2268 Also you would be paying for a whole pallet (X2 because of the minimums) even if you have 1 unit left on it and to make it worse you don't know so you can't do anything about it [0.5293723]
2269 It is very hard to change a warehouse once you are stuck with one so do your research before you make the mistake we did [0.9712855]
2273 what they actually receive and enter into the system [0.9909418]
2277 " One more thing [0.78031915]
2280 Capterra is a paid service and they will only post reviews they like this review never showed up there even though it was posted there over 3 months ago didn't even get an acknowledgement [0.4054577]
2284 Their management team is non existent [0.986967]
2286 Shipmonk was a great resource for us when we first started doing ecomm but didn't have the ability to fulfill ourselves [0.9635905]
2292 It's now 9 [0.9901593]
2298 So I have no option but to voice my concerns here instead [0.77379346]
2304 What a waste of time and business [0.55367744]
2306 We've been using Shipmonk for a year and half now and it has honestly been the most painful part of running a business [0.94273996]
2310 what they actually receive and enter into the system [0.9909418]
2315 There is literally no one even at the highest levels that will address their process issues or the huge costly mistakes they constantly make [0.9281786]
2322 Calling their agents "happiness engineers" is a literal farce [0.97836316]
2323 If you think running a business is hard try running one using Shipmonk [0.98251987]
2324 If I can give advice to anyone looking for a fulfillment center it would be to avoid Shipmonk and ask other services really detailed questions about how they handle issues [0.41822925]
2325 I would give Shipmonk negative stars if I could and ask for the weeks of my life back that were spent agonizing over all the problems they've caused that have been ludicrous or impossible to fix [0.8821071]
2327 Had struggles with many fulfilment partners before [0.934216]
2328 Mistakes happen in fulfilment but fast and proper communication is key [0.9516848]
2329 Shipmonk has proven to be a great partner for us [0.95040673]
2330 Really BAD company [0.41828755]
2331 I would recommend to stay away from [0.99600893]
2333 Every single part of the cycle has been horrendus horrible tiring and filled with mistakes from ShipMonk's end [0.951891]
2335 Bad [0.8949504]
2336 Bad [0.8949504]
2337 Bad [0.8949504]
2338 And as with every bad company LEAVING and STOPPING the relationship has been a very long tedius and PAINFUL experience [0.97186124]
2340 A bad company is bad in the beginning - and also in the end apparently [0.8662512]
2347 We soldiered on but eventually grew tired of all the nickel and diming with 4% surcharges on all account payment methods except ACH payments ridiculous "packaging material" charges (for standard size cartons and void fill) which should be part of the Pick n Pack fee and high storage fees due to the way they spread your stock out [0.64513206]
2348 They also lost half a pallet of stock for a week or so (had to close Amazon listing and ShipMonk blamed their warehouse workers for it - great training there guys [0.46564063]
2350 TL;DR: While I hear ShipBob is just as bad there must be better options elsewhere [0.9744203]
2351 Not recommended stay away unless you enjoy unnecessary stress and expense [0.9486862]
2352 Incredible experience working with Shipmonk [0.9147968]
2353 I have worked with a few 3PLs for my business and this has been the smoothest operation I have encountered [0.7417231]
2354 They receive product well notify when in stock the dashboard is very communicative and connects well with my store [0.9159246]
2355 Overall I would recommend them to all of my fellow eComm businesses [0.99593794]
2356 Awesome experience working with Shipmonk [0.915153]
2357 The service is amazing [0.5412291]
2360 In the beginning we had some hiccups and then things improved as we moved along [0.8359555]
2361 They have been quick to create solutions for problems that we have encountered [0.96484953]
2362 We use their service mostly to fulfill our wholesale B2B order to major retail companies such as CVS Walmart and Target [0.46436632]
2363 We continuously send them containers directly from our factory [0.9127127]
2364 Outsourcing the work has helped us focus on what matters the most and that is selling [0.97960997]
2365 I am giving ShipMonk a 5-Star review for various reasons [0.99846166]
2371 ShipMonk has made it possible for me to run my business remotely from anywhere in the world which I am truly appreciative and grateful for [0.9965284]
2372 Cheers Toulaish CEO SleepBliss [0.9415119]
2374 We used Shipmonk Integration with Shopify has been seamless [0.9473538]
2375 I definitely recommend [0.99600905]
2376 Couldn't agree more with some of the bad reviews [0.9082966]
2382 Nothing to do with size or weight [0.7538919]
2385 Had to spend a ton of money to relocate all of our product [0.93135065]
2386 Nightmare Avoid Avoid Avoid [0.78690124]
2387 I've had a terrible experience with this company [0.43854737]
2390 Until this date they never returned my products [0.6803095]
2391 Be aware of this company [0.44607323]
2394 000 usd and not issued any credit - had to call to my bank to make a chargeback [0.53913784]
2398 Integration with Shopify has been seamless [0.9500882]
2399 You can tell they are investing in adding more tools as well [0.968558]
2400 Would definitely recommend [0.99600905]
2403 Helpful support [0.98436975]
2404 Would definitely recommend [0.99600905]
2405 Went to ShipMonk from a recommendation of a good friend [0.98316264]
2407 Ship monk helped us grow our company and was there when we needed them [0.51300365]
2412 I even talked with Jan the CEO only to receive no help or support [0.9913752]
2415 Also getting the BOL to our driver was hell [0.97095704]
2416 The stress of working with this company started giving me panic attacks which is the LAST THING I need as a startup founder [0.7730654]
2417 When we'd go to pick up or drop off we had to load and unload all of our pallets OURSELVES which is actually illegal and violates their "safety requirements [0.6619176]
2419 DO NOT WORK WITH THIS COMPANY [0.986993]
2420 THIS WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME SUCK OF MY LIFE [0.99430656]
2421 If I didn't work with shitmonk I'd have $7,000 more in the bank and wouldn't be on Zoloft [0.9270839]
2422 I've talked to many 3PL's across the country and ShipMonk is one of the best i've seen [0.98617506]
2426 Shipmonk is an incredible experience [0.9863941]
2429 Very simple to integrate with online [0.9919963]
2430 Very helpful with every step of the business from beginning to end [0.6453214]
2431 Shipmonk has been an incredible service for our business [0.40930468]

2437 We have integrated ours with Shopify store [0.46746713]
2439 We can highly recommend it [0.99600905]
2440 Cool company great dash board fast and efficient [0.42333025]

2445 Wonderful experience working with Shipmonk [0.91555583]
2446 Great for startups of all sizes [0.6854849]
2448 Absolutely AWFUL company [0.52291805]
2449 At all costs avoid using them for your business [0.49472526]
2450 This company has potentially costs us tens of thousands of dollars [0.42167574]
2452 And they never communicated with us ANYTHING [0.8833533]
2453 This picture shows how I have had to hound them down for a response [0.81705457]
2455 I've dealt with SO MANY CHARGEBACKS that my bank had to discontinue service with us [0.87506783]
2456 WORST BUSINESS DECISION EVER DECIDING TO WORK WITH THEM AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE [0.9850541]
2458 We were assigned a designated Happiness Engineer (HE) who walked us through an onboarding session to get our team familiarized with the system [0.56777245]
2460 When our HE was not available it was easy to reach out to Shipmonk for assistance by submitting a ticket online in which we would receive a response within 24 hours [0.9874695]
2461 The only drawback that we experience is the communication between pacific and eastern time [0.97117925]
2463 Overall we are satisfied with Shipmonk’s services and team of professionals [0.5974739]
2468 Overall highly satisfied with ShipMonk [0.96606946]
2469 We've been using Shipmonk (and their associated Shopify app) for more than a year now [0.7395748]
2477 4 out of 6 were tarnished [0.94313014]
2478 we got terrible reviews on our own trustpilot so we're paying it forward [0.82859236]
2479 Shipmonk is awesome [0.9864283]
2480 I've used multiple 3PL's in the past and they all sucked Shipmonk is the first one I havent had any issues with [0.98643327]
2482 This was way to much work for just me & my husband to handle yet we handled it [0.97199017]
2488 Even on items we only sent 16 of they say we miscounted and only had 13 [0.48152977]
2489 I'm pretty sure I know the difference between 13 and 16 [0.657677]
2497 You better believe this is also going to lead to some less than five star reviews for my shop too [0.9846948]
2498 Shipmonk is the worst 3PL we have ever worked with - and that is not an understatement [0.44720024]
2500 In the process they were negligent in communication and would also never take ownership of the problem and find a solution [0.90143925]
2501 The disaster continues [0.7179442]
2504 Highly recommended [0.9488471]

2661 Deliverr does not really live up to its standards [0.9701712]
2665 I fulfill items myself and compared to Deliverr I am way faster [0.5210596]
2666 I can show concrete examples as proof to everything I have just stated here [0.8870274]
2667 Please Deliverr Improve [0.98630387]
2668 Improve your services [0.59477955]
2669 Avoid using Deliverr they were about 84% on-time ship rate for us before we had to ship from our 3PL for the delayed orders to meet platform KPI [0.514176]
2674 I (my pocketbook too [0.47571638]
2675 ) regret trying Deliverr [0.9428294]
2677 Link it with EDI SaaS like shipstation find an account with discounted ship rates and you'll end up having more reliability and about the same cost even without the economy of scale [0.49237284]
2679 I was looking for answers regarding how to expand beyond our current portfolio [0.9494936]
2681 I was then able to connect with one of the folks at Deliverr Brian Williams [0.98408806]

2720 Don't do it [0.8158142]
2721 I have been a Deliverr client for 16 months [0.93224216]
2722 Their service is a great concept and prices are great and it started out OK but they are growing way too fast or something [0.43571]
2729 - Their support is helpful but EXTREMELY slow [0.987955]
2733 They literally stick your product inside a big cardboard box and seal it up [0.717631]
2736 I do not recommend them anymore [0.99600905]
2737 Deliver has really came through for me this year [0.99993795]
2740 We bet on Deliverr and are very happy with the results [0.98202616]
2741 We started with Deliverr in 2018 [0.8928525]
2743 With FBA disrupted Deliverr did an amazing job scaling their operations to handle a ton of new demand in a tough environment [0.938398]
2744 They are the first company - even before Walmart or any of the other incumbents - to succeed in creating a viable FBA alternative [0.5123284]
2745 I sent 2000 units for the first time and they lost 800 units [0.70339316]
2746 I sent the second time 6600 units and the lost 2000 units [0.7033814]
2748 This is a horrible company [0.9339451]
2750 Last time took 3 months [0.9392688]
2751 It is horrible [0.98642844]
2752 Site looks easy to use but that's where the positives end [0.6229832]
2753 Outbound SLAs are frequently missed with no penalty [0.42347467]
2756 Shipments are frequently lost or tracking information is simply incorrect and the claims policy is inconsistent [0.5794748]
2759 I have had customers contact me to let me know they have received 10s of extra units they did not order (and I can only imaging how many hundreds of units are out in the world that customers have not let me know they have) [0.56556815]
2760 Support team is not well trained and obviously understaffed as tickets take days and sometimes weeks to receive a response [0.9838518]
2764 I got all answers I need [0.56785023]
2765 Great help [0.862098]
2767 Great feedback [0.9242374]
2768 I was offered great detail and content about my situation in order for me to make an informed decision about my business [0.721285]

2774 reliable fast and easy interface for sellers [0.80463773]
2775 The Deliverr team has been instrumental in helping Kaspien execute on our marketplace growth strategies and providing creative business solutions through this extremely volatile time in supply chain management [0.7193378]
2777 We appreciate all of the support from the Deliverr team [0.9836388]
2778 Deliverr has been a great partner to us over the years [0.95703787]
2782 Their system randomly does not connect with Walmart and ebay [0.9702642]
2783 Support is virtually nill [0.9947754]
2785 They reached out to make it right I will see what happens and update accordingly [0.9648408]
2787 They have ZERO support [0.98353]
2789 Our AM has been kind but she definitely misled us during on our onboarding [0.6182878]
2790 I feel bad for her because she has to do the work of this awful company [0.4218729]
2791 I wish we never started doing business with Deliverr because they're solely responsible for crippling our US business which is detrimental to us as an apparel startup [0.9814585]
2793 Tyler and Nick are awesome and always down to help [0.9785434]
2794 You will never feel that they are from a company you're working with they're more of friends who are always willing to lend their helping hands and go extra when it comes to assistance on Deliverr [0.8738381]
2799 They have been great to work with especially our account manager Damian has been super helpfull and is alway quick to respond to any questions [0.9983446]
2800 We had some issues with meeting the cut off point for sending in stock for Black Friday due to our logistics partner but it all got processed on time and we are in good shape now [0.6219557]
2801 Their rates are highly competitive and can't be beat [0.9676681]
2802 Our products have smallish profit margins and they were the only company that was able to make self fulfillment worth our while [0.4409862]
2803 Deliverr has been great for me since day 1 [0.9526469]
2804 I have dealt with Shawn & Damian and they are both superb in terms of helping me with everything I need [0.98325855]
2805 I've had multiple hiccups and they are super quick to respond and get things fixed in a very timely manner [0.9985284]
2809 They are not a well oiled machine and have not been able to grow into the pants they wish to wear [0.9749068]
2810 When you have inevitable problems that are costing you money you just cant get a resolution out of them [0.968057]
2812 No chat no phone no responsible support [0.9517403]
2813 For they type of business they are doing they should be more responsive [0.96519494]
2814 Even before the crazy recent growth they failed at this [0.6327052]
2815 I know they are the only game in town so I continue to use them but they make me uncomfortable knowing they are unable to stop loosing me money [0.98375446]
2817 I want to talk with a representative at the company before I spend money with them [0.4306954]
2818 Not having any phone contact signals to me that they expect trust without any upfront conversation with a real person [0.5619515]
2819 I do not operate my business this way [0.9927229]
2821 A Sales person did contact me and I am happy with the conversation [0.57752436]
2822 Looking forward to working with Deliverr moving forward [0.68474007]
2829 Deliverr is able to connect with all main marketplaces and provide fast tags across the board [0.9956043]
2831 Meanwhile they constantly release new product features as well as visionary thought leadership content [0.9310308]
2832 Love it [0.9554649]
2836 I am supremely impressed by their efforts and how much they cared [0.9994597]
2837 As if it was their own business [0.89103925]
2840 I use Shopify and now everything Is streamlined I don't have to touch anything [0.9559885]
2841 Editing my review - Their Business Operations manager reached out to me and helped me sort all previous issues [0.9612627]
2843 Having said that I have decided not to do business with Deliverr anymore (overall not a good experience) I wish I could give them ZERO stars [0.5557374]
2847 Being a business owner myself I generally prefer not to leave bad reviews for anyone but these guys left no other option for me [0.8817877]
2850 They also offered support and resources for marketing our products [0.7367191]
2851 Overall we're quite pleased with our decision to use Deliverr and look forward to scaling with their services [0.5930951]
2852 regret ever joining them [0.9430843]
2853 Inbounds are rarely received within the said time frame [0.9828026]
2855 All they will do is reimburse you (for the customers who cared to complain [0.7481134]
2856 The others will simply never come back [0.9366236]
2858 They will promise it won't happen again then it does the very next few days [0.97147405]
2861 They cannot manage their business [0.5523009]
2862 Yet i entrusted mine in their hands to manage [0.7527635]
2863 As im writing im still waiting for them to receive my inbound [0.98880774]
2864 8 days delayed [0.93467367]
2866 So we from Deliverr are treated as second class [0.98321944]
2867 Explains the inbound receiving delays All their failures are now blamed on Covid-19😏 [0.9115551]
2868 Leaving you is a releif [0.9864255]
2869 Its been great [0.953138]
2870 Deliverr is one of the best fulfillment services out there [0.5023784]
2871 It rivals and beats FBA in many categories [0.99699676]
2872 The UI is easy to work with there are always improvements and new integrations [0.868544]
2873 Sometimes there are some small issues here and there but in the end they always get solved [0.98279834]
2874 I look forward for more and more growth and improvements [0.6695542]
2876 Inbound can be expensive but they assist with that sometimes [0.8981915]
2877 Support is always good [0.9968802]

2880 Deliverr has helped to build my business to new channels and new levels [0.5588218]
2881 The staff at Deliverr is very helpful and actually very encouraging and motivating to help us build our business in ways we didn't know were available [0.9748859]
2882 I highly recommend using Deliverr if you are interested in scaling your business [0.9957386]
2884 com platform [0.9166403]
2887 There are some aspects that can be improved but Deliverr is doing its' best during this pandemic with the resources available [0.97381485]
2888 There are two aspects of Deliverr that I find unique and advantageous [0.98242223]
2889 First we are able to receive support from an actual person [0.99136734]
2890 Our growth manager has been consistent about checking in with us and helping our company thrive with Deliverr (Thanks Tyler [0.5323386]
2894 This feature is clever and allows us to expand our offers easily among several platforms [0.9872126]
2895 Now there are a few flaws [0.98322266]
2901 Almost 1 year working with them is 9 [0.98611444]
2902 8/10 bc nobody is perfect [0.9864273]
2903 We see a long way working together [0.8240337]
2904 Deliverr has been a lifesaver for us [0.9505565]
2911 However Deliverr does a great job at owning their mistakes and processing claims [0.74884367]
2915 Damian Sandenbergh is my Rep now and he has proven extremely helpful [0.9862614]
2917 When I have experienced serious issues within a reasonable time period Deliverr has stepped up to the plate and helped to reach win-win solutions [0.96887356]
2919 Mistakes happen what we do about them is what separates winners from losers [0.98642975]
2920 Deliverr is a winner I highly recommend them [0.99588615]
2922 When minor discrepancies did arise the Deliverr team assigned an active representative to help us resolve them in a timely and professional manner [0.8407457]
2924 You can tell Deliverr appreciates each of their clients and wants them to succeed [0.8058497]
2925 Deliverr has gone above and beyond expectations so far [0.6687631]
2928 and was extremely impressed [0.9824887]
2929 This is not a back office call center team [0.96062154]
2931 The support doesn't stop there either I'm going to be working with an engagement manager to help me optimize my e-commerce sites [0.93486387]
2934 As a small business owner I'm excited to take my business to the next level and Deliverr has made it incredibly easy [0.56125015]
2939 I feel bad for already recommending Deliverr to a couple of people will not make this mistake again [0.97513807]
2940 The following is a complaint message sent to our account manager at Deliverr [0.68765557]
2941 WE did not receive a response [0.9913131]
2942 Tyler Our account has been inaccesible for 3 days now without resolution--the system stopped recognizing it [0.43933183]
2943 We will be moving both of our accounts to another service as soon as possible: • Tech support is incompetent often referring problems to “other team members” who then fail to respond in a timely manner if at all [0.86780417]
2944 • Tech support response time is never prompt sometimes taking 48 hours+ to respond that a response is coming [0.9979543]
2946 This isn’t enough in case of an emergency and there does not appear to be any prioritization of support requests [0.9465366]
2948 • All businesses must deal with the problems of the Corona Virus but Deliverr has demonstrated no ability to adapt or improve its support [0.71935374]
2949 We request you forward this information as far up the company ladder as possible [0.64027363]
2950 Deliverr is a company that is “in over its head [0.96733636]
2951 ” SDS Worldwide/DARA INC [0.94485605]
2952 My company has had a very good experience with Deliverr and could definitely recommend them [0.9942788]
2953 We sell supplements and were looking for a new pick pack ship partner around 2 months ago [0.5596262]
2954 We chose Deliverr over ShipBob and so far are very happy with our choice [0.9830161]
2961 - Our account executive Shawn Sprauer did a great job both during the sales process and while we were onboarding with Deliverr [0.6436032]
2962 He also helped us get approved to sell on Walmart and really made a difference during the Walmart onboarding process [0.7772733]
2966 MAIN ISSUES 1 [0.92024434]
2971 2 [0.9394844]
2974 YESSS its 2020 and this is still happening [0.9863396]
2975 3 [0.94197536]
2978 Be prepared for that sales channel to lock into your Deliverr account FOREVER [0.46857095]
