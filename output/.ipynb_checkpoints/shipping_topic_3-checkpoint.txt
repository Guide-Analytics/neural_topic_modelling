26 We look forward to continue shipping to international destinations [0.99572337]

196 Lack of response on VAT or GST invoices for shipments to Canada and Japan [0.9730567]
200 Difficulty in getting invoice details (VAT charges vs [0.8205876]
201 Shipping related charges) aligned with payments [0.8601598]
204 amazing company [0.5725656]
208 Excellent customer service and easy to use shipping/dashboard [0.5026641]
216 If you're like me that question is the one that kept popping up every time I needed to decide if we could really afford to outsource the fulfillment of orders [0.82071924]
219 And when orders pop up on my phone while I'm spending time with my kids (or sleeping [0.85878044]

273 Shipbob reduced my shipping costs by 1/3 [0.9957097]
274 I highly recommend their service and thank their customer service reps [0.4071023]
278 They took longer than promised to get inventory ready to ship [0.965229]
288 Their staff is very helpful and the user interface to manage your shipments is very easy to navigate [0.9999191]
292 They made it so easy to setup fulfillment to basically compete with Amazon [0.52543086]

308 Every time we have concerns with the shipment be it ShipBob or courier error they never fail to accommodate us [0.99999577]
311 I sent my inventory in and they received and it connected perfectly with my woocommerce store plugin [0.9595632]
312 Honestly very easy to setup and making sales daily and shipping :) [0.9949396]
314 The only reason for 4 stars rather than five was on the basis that although the goods arrived at the center on the 20th of Feb they were apparently only processed on the 24th [0.5168371]
323 After our e-commerce sales went from 0 to 12,000 units in under a month we desperately needed help with fulfillment [0.7610242]
325 Their flexibility customer service and attention to detail have been outstanding [0.46997446]
337 We are very happy with their competitive shipping prices and speed in which they process orders [0.9948525]
349 The warehouse is also a challenge [0.7650156]
350 I have had WRO's broken and discarded before I could make a claim with my insurance company [0.55731034]
354 Great customer service [0.50948507]
356 What I particularly love is the ease of use & fast onboarding that ShipBob enables The one thing you'd hear merchants complain about was lack of international shipping [0.9905826]
357 Well now ShipBob has 11 fulfillment centers with more on the way [0.4732816]
358 Highly recommend to anyone shipping high volume across the globe [0.99535245]
365 Honestly the best decision made in regards to getting my products delivered to customers quickly and affordably [0.60468596]
368 ShipBob has been an amazing shipping partner to work with [0.9956733]
370 She was instantly available for any help I needed to understand the system and during the busy shipping times of the holiday season [0.9956746]
371 Besides this the customer support team is reliable too [0.51404154]
375 The dashboard is clean and intuitive exactly what you want when running your fulfillment business [0.47131905]
380 Highly recommend to any seller [0.84811914]

384 Lastly we use fulfilment companies around the world on their online tools are fantastic and make it very easy to see exactly what is happening with order fulfilment and inbound orders [0.90779436]
389 For the past months that we have been with ShipBob was the BEST shipping partner experience we ever had ever since we started our company 5 years ago [0.9956824]
390 Their implementation team transition team shipping staff made sure that we are on Cloud Nine with our stay with them [0.99570185]
393 Competitive prices and amazing customer service team [0.50758946]
396 very patient and encouraging [0.45197093]
400 I would not have rated this company five stars a year ago but they're really gotten their s%$t together and I'm very happy with the improvement [0.5717937]
401 Their customer service has gone from a big negative to very strong and our times and rates remain reasonable [0.4676201]
405 While Shipbob has top of the line fulfillment software that is simple and easy to use for anyone the real help has been in how much time they take to ensure your operation gets up and running and you feel comfortable working with the and using their system [0.4594829]
410 Worst company ever [0.57256377]
413 They constantly got our products lost and shipped out late [0.96003187]
417 I am trying to get an FBA shipment out from March 12 and even after 31 days after opening 7-8 tickets numerous phone calls and having a meeting supervisor my shipment is not out yet [0.99999577]
424 We would have figured that due to their volume for shipping the costs would be lower than if we did it ourselves [0.995703]
426 They charged us $7 to ship something that we previously were able to put the product in an envelope and put a forever stamp on it and then they charged us $26 dollars to ship a hat and a Nalgene bottle [0.913463]
427 Total cost when we shipped it ourselves [0.9896557]
429 00 We ended up losing money to fullfill our first round of orders for our national campaign so we had to get everything shipped back to us which was also a loss [0.9819917]
430 I am just REALLY glad that we figured this out before we turned up the volume on our order fullfillment [0.9139457]
431 Getting started with customer experience fulfillment is just plain hard [0.5119334]
441 I am expanding my business into Canada organised a first time shipment of goods through the easy to use website [0.99999577]
442 ShipBob support notified me I had not attached the required invoice for international goods in a polite and informative manner [0.8188895]
444 Overall the service is Ok the shipping is a bit slow but still the job is done well the main problem is transfer to the Amazon warehouse the first time took 3 weeks before they finally send 1 poor carton the second time was better almost 14 days before shipping [0.99551964]
446 Multi location shipping near the customer [0.9791106]
448 The near customer stuff is just usps regular slow mail [0.86983776]
450 In the world of next day Amazon this doesn't cut it [0.56696695]
451 So then we started shipping 2 or 3 day mail from these nearby locations [0.9864069]
452 The price was nearly double what we pay now [0.7166908]
454 So they lure you in with cheap super slow shipping and cash in on the faster stuff [0.9957237]
455 And having multiple locations is an inventory nightmare [0.95768076]
456 I went with a place that has 1 location (see other reviews) and they ship everywhere super fast via FedEx [0.95230967]
458 But I'm telling you the customers demand faster [0.59065855]
461 All the functionality you need to run an efficient operation is there and the pricing is fair [0.62250626]
465 Their software is simple to use intuitive and full of functionalities where other warehouses would just say "email customer support" [0.50463164]
466 Their reimbursement policies are reasonable and completely hassle free (completely unlike the terribly tedious and long process to file a claim with UPS for example) [0.6945687]
468 Where they can improve would be to decrease their lead time for B2B orders [0.9093316]
469 Some commercial customers aren't willing to wait for the 4 day SLA to pack plus additional transit time for their large orders [0.88772774]
470 But this is a small price to pay for all the above [0.69132733]
471 If only Shipbob had warehouses in continental Europe and Australia - we would use them for 100% of our warehousing and fulfillment needs [0.46990484]
473 There quick efficient and the customer service is top notch [0.5005799]
476 Great company amazing for all your distribution needs [0.6908446]
480 50 per shipped order [0.98965424]
483 They are constantly raising their prices per shipped order which is highly unprofessional [0.9890425]
488 Ship bob is the best fulfillment service I ever used [0.40578815]
491 I’m not sure if I like their pricing yet so I’m reserving a star [0.69004023]
492 I’ll re-review in a few months [0.617638]
493 Slow shipping times TONS of inventory leakage (Most likely due to seasonal employees that are just stealing inventory) and HIGH HIGH HIGH fees [0.9955831]
495 I will stick with my "mom and pop" warehouses thank you [0.7858381]
496 I wanted to do a test run with them so I sent them a few boxes of items (1/4 of a pallet stationery products) [0.680265]
503 They are being kept in 339 bins 2 shelves and 1 pallet [0.47471315]
504 At the time of writing bins are $5 each shelves $10 each and pallets $40 [0.6291627]
506 How the flying dutchman do you store 1/4 pallet of things in all those places [0.8541696]
507 If you read their support pages it says their staff are trained to store in a way that would be as efficient as possible to save the customer money [0.51411414]
512 All in all I only lost a few hundred dollars and some time [0.47514042]
516 If you value your time look elsewhere [0.40299392]
518 It is so nice to be able to actually speak with someone and get the support and assistance we have been looking for in a shipping company [0.99520975]
521 The interface is clear and easy to use and the pricing is reasonable [0.611909]
526 Smooth setup process and orders are being delivered quickly [0.8803657]
529 With me Shipbob never made a single delivery on schedule this past year [0.9750634]
530 I can understand that given the state of delays with this pandemic but what I can't excuse is this: Shipbob was routinely over-reporting the amount of storage space required to warehouse my inventory in order to charge me higher for storage costs [0.9598765]
531 When I cleared out my inventory to use another 3PL service I decided to dispose of the inventory and they charged me more on disposal than it would have cost me to ship my inventory internationally [0.9106803]
533 Claiming my inventory occupies way more space that is remotely believable - this is how they inflate their profits [0.9588049]
546 The platform is extremely easy to use and the fulfillment is extremely fast [0.43102214]
548 Being new to online sales and fulfillment I needed a lot of hand holding [0.91382366]
552 I am looking forward to syncing up to my Amazon Seller Central site in the next week [0.48461372]
555 Huge range of global shipping options no monthly minimums competitive pricing and great service [0.99046385]
562 Their pricing structure makes the most sense to me and it has been working wonderfully for my business [0.6888874]
565 Using ShipBob’s order fulfillment service was the best thing I’ve ever done for my business [0.46179873]
566 Especially during this pandemic I was really struggling to get orders delivered on time [0.91653347]
569 They really prepared me to have all the necessary tools and knowledge for when I was ready to start processing orders and were always available if I had any questions or concerns [0.9163696]
570 Overall the dashboard is super nice and easy to use shipping costs are affordable and transit times are great [0.9955694]
571 They really made fulfilling orders super simple for me and my clients [0.9165759]
575 Your hand is held throughout the whole thing until your fulfillment is exactly where you want it [0.46765783]
588 I had a slight hiccup in ship times due to COVID but that was more a carrier issue and they dealt with it completely with grace [0.9006992]
591 The growing pains of a new startup company are real and things went from 0 to 100 with my company SO fast [0.51133496]
592 I went from 5 orders a day up to 40 orders a day and was tasked with way more work than I could handle at the time - shipping orders working on ads and communicating with customers [0.9942548]
593 ShipBob took a lot of that stress off of me by handling all of my fulfillment [0.47331285]
597 Numerous errors that made us look bad in front of our customers one of which was inserting flammable material in one of the packages sent to our customers [0.7852895]
601 She was the first person I encountered that really took the time to break it down in *laymens* terms about exactly what I should be thinking about & how to identify when it's the right time to outsource my shipping in a way that works best for me & my biz [0.9913763]
608 The interface is smooth and now I can have my fragile glass bottles shipped without worrying about them breaking [0.9866814]
613 Many times more expensive than using the USPS or even Amazon [0.79776233]
614 Beware of the costs to become a merchant and the costs to end your contract - even when your contract has already expired [0.66572326]
616 On top of that multiple customers received damaged products [0.63010275]
622 Our business has grown and our customers are happy with the delivery speed [0.71084523]
624 Coming from handling shipping myself this process couldn't have gone better [0.99571806]
628 Seems they losted some units but they refund it once I show the invoice [0.8231664]
633 Excellent fulfillment and good support [0.47328523]
635 I really miss an ios app though with analytics and orders [0.8945939]
644 The fulfillment of our products has been good [0.4937003]
646 We transferred our inventory from Ruby Has to Shipbob [0.9601212]
648 Ruby has made so many mistakes including not attaching the WROs to the pallets [0.76225454]
649 Karley saved the day by finding our pallets and making sure they were received properly [0.76346076]
651 Great service with reasonable pricing [0.6866111]
654 You can create shipments manually and the system can pull the orders automatically from your website [0.99992037]
655 The shipping cost is also low [0.9957188]
656 Had a simple request for a shipment that is arriving at their centre in a few weeks - that when our product is picked & packed each item needs to be removed from a black gift box before being placed in the last mile shipping box [0.9999868]
657 The first customer support rep was unhelpful and claimed this was not possible [0.5072533]
658 I continued to pursue this request in good faith that they could come through for my basic kitting request [0.50920904]
662 Do yourself a favor and go with a fulfillment centre who actually cares about the customer and can fulfill simple requests when they come up [0.5065855]
664 Far easier than getting stuff configured at Amazon (by an order of magnitude) [0.5194783]
666 ShipBob has caused months of business outages that have cost our small company $20k+ in cash burn [0.49833035]
668 Their customer support and executive team have been completely unhelpful in resolving any of the issues that have caused a string of business outages that add up to $20k+ in cash burn [0.5019246]
669 Their own employees tell us that they aren't even surprised any longer at the incompetence and issues at this company [0.53144914]
672 I won't even get into how much they overcharge small businesses on things like return shipping labels [0.9956768]
673 If you are looking for a fulfillment center DO NOT use ShipBob [0.47328606]
678 Go explore other fulfillment options [0.47332385]
680 The fulfilment of our products have been good and have received little complains from our customers despite the pandemic [0.60541147]
682 It's important to configure correctly the shipping methods [0.89447635]
689 I was able to get a complete e-commerce and distribution system up and running in record time (just a hand full of days) [0.6991152]
691 I’ve finally received my inventory and they basically dumped my products in a box with broken edges and a strip of tape [0.95816785]
692 Some of the inventory is made of paper and now damaged [0.9542884]
694 Here’s snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect: - Firstly if I did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob would’ve stopped my business for an entire month [0.94703144]
695 - shipbob stole some of my inventory [0.9601559]
696 They claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesn’t know how to count [0.95996994]
700 - I requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless they’ve handled it I doubt that is gonna happen [0.95998687]
701 - I asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because I absolutely no longer trust them [0.96012264]
702 They denied the request [0.42441633]
705 They told me kitting would cost $1 [0.66984606]
714 - Your orders will not be sent out on time [0.9148249]
716 - I was going to do a pre-order sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 (F I V E) orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship FIVE orders [0.9528844]
721 - Do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management’ it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call [0.45780963]
742 - Do not be fooled by reports of growth and investors pouring money into the company [0.48943067]
748 Being left hanging for a month with now way to fulfill orders for our customers at a critical time (6 week into pandemic) was a serious risk for our company [0.8800129]
749 We turned to ShipBob for help and they were able to get us setup in their system and ready to receive our inventory for fulfillment in only a few days [0.9325889]
751 Their backend interface is very intuitive and allows us to have a lot of control over our fulfillment from holding orders to kitting [0.6685311]
753 Super expensive shipping and handling and overcharging in warehouses [0.99571407]
754 Very slow inventorying [0.69988585]
755 I have been charged $90 in one warehouse for 38 units and $40 for 64 in another for the same units [0.56201893]
757 I also sell on Amazon FBA Amazon would is about 300 to 400% cheaper [0.57707703]
758 I trusted them because I saw that they are raked as nr 1 fulfillment in the US but it's totally opposite [0.46398562]
761 I still have stock in their fulfillment but I will be moving to a different company for sure because I don't see them as a long-term partner which is crucial for e-commerce business [0.54216677]
766 They allow us to scale without spending more time fulfilling orders [0.91699225]
773 I love seeing new orders come through for my e-commerce business but my least favorite part was fulfilling them [0.9167632]
776 I am also very impressed with how quickly the orders get fulfilled and all of the reporting features that are available to enable optimization [0.8905988]
783 They showed early commitment to customer and employee health by adopting PPE well before most 3PL's were using it [0.5118713]
787 I was holding off on leaving a review until my inventory returned to me in full and I got the $2k+ refund from their shipping mistake on my account but now they missed their SLA again and I have no idea when I'm getting my inventory back so here goes [0.98629904]
792 Their dimensional pricing sounds fine until you realize they do not care at all about what size box they use [0.6900182]
794 1 cu ft) that can fit into a 7x7x3 box [0.6676744]
795 Their team was putting it into HUGE boxes and charging us dimensional pricing on their error [0.6943713]
796 This is the difference between a ~$5 shipping charge and a $32 shipping charge [0.99570626]
802 I have spoken to so many former customers that have had the same exact experience I have and I can't understand how I didn't see it before I signed up [0.59030646]
806 If I have a problem their customer service staff are knowledgeable and courteous and my problem is solved very quickly [0.4738157]
812 My primary complaints are related to some minor Shopify/Amazon integration issues and the expensive 2-day shipping rates [0.9944853]
813 We have yet to determine if the fulfillment and shipping times are competitive since all supply chains have been slowed down by COVID [0.9954474]
814 I have also been really impressed with the responsiveness of their support and customer success teams [0.5115835]
818 Long delivery times signature confirmation etc [0.9586915]
824 I have found ShipBob to provide a customer service experience beyond my expectation [0.50575453]
827 They say one thing and it seems all good but then they ship and pack a different way at your expense with apologies galore or blame the analytics of the system or mostly blame you for not knowing how to use their system or not setting it up right [0.89532137]
828 NOT worth the aggravation sorting out doubled freight doubled inventory costs [0.9899475]
834 I'm thrilled to be working with a company that prides itself so much on customer service [0.50693953]
839 There are better distributors out there [0.97594357]

849 I’m getting flooded with 1 star reviews from customers who haven’t received their orders after more than 2 weeks [0.8779058]
850 One order I just checked did not get handed off to carrier until 10 days after label was created [0.6366114]
851 Also they take my inventory and send it to different locations without my consent/request then tell me my item is out of stock when I have more than 20 on hand but can’t ship them because they moved them around [0.95707506]
852 I am done with this service that is costing me customers and lost revenue [0.4969049]
855 Although their customer support is nice to speak to they have gone from a channel to provide suggestions to warehouse ops (issue escalation option is non-existent) to powerless robots making repetitive promises that things will be handled "soon" [0.5059308]
862 Our latest shipments are 10 business days into processing with no news but they are still marked as Green/within the SLA because new ticket means new deadlines [0.9999204]
872 Shipbob provides a great service for me to inventory my products [0.94814605]
873 Using their online platform I can seamlessly transfer inventory from my suppliers as well place shipping orders to my customers [0.9939262]
876 Some of the worst customer service I've ever encountered [0.49901837]
883 I'm new to fulfillment and not having my products in the same city was at first a bit scary but since there's always someone available to answer my questions and help me understand the process everything works great [0.5030932]
887 Their sales team was phenomenal in selling me on a service that wasn’t delivered [0.93866843]
888 Shipbob has had my product dimensions and weights incorrect in the system driving my shipping costs way up [0.9956759]
889 It took a month (yes a full month [0.9065797]
892 Because they contract out of a fulfillment center in Tampa (which by the way no one told me - I had to Google the Tampa address) my weights will be incorrect for weeks because the communication between the companies is brutal [0.46123192]
895 Don’t be fooled by their sales team [0.9732399]
900 Our first order was shipped very late in a bubble envelop yet charged for the price of the biggest box they have (over 85$ for a small 30$ product) [0.95626575]
902 And now it's taking them ages to pack my stock so I can remove it and ship it to another fulfillment company [0.6430455]
907 Their sales guys did a wrong sell and upon complaining I got asked to move my inventory away from their warehouse [0.9594792]

933 Best part they didn't actually answer it when I saw they were sending out the wrong packages [0.92129934]
936 The people were decent enough but wow I'm not sure I could look myself in the mirror if I was selling what they were [0.8845124]

950 We now have over a 16% late shipment rate even though we use all 4 warehouses [0.9999958]
951 Amazon demands under a 4% late rate [0.5720992]
954 -They are slow to ship orders out [0.9439759]
955 -They are SUPER slow to receive inventory [0.94697684]

994 ShipBob has the best customer service I've ever experienced [0.5048252]
1001 Working with Shipbob has allowed us to split our inventory across multiple fulfillment centers to lower our shipping costs and delivery times [0.9944996]
1002 Their technology and analytics software provide all the data and information we need to make decisions on inventory planning and inventory distribution [0.78166145]

1013 I can also plan my inventory better using this tool [0.9601322]
1014 Here is the cool feature that I liked the most: As the orders increase and more data comes through I can play around switch on and off different warehouses and see the projected shipping rates and average shipping times [0.9956333]
1016 Because now I can figure out what warehouses should I send my product to in order to get the best saving in terms of shipping rates and the best customer experience in terms of average shipping time [0.994896]
1032 ShipBob has been a positive fulfillment partner in the shipping technology space [0.9950837]
1034 EasyPost is proud to work with ShipBob as we partner together to redefine e-commerce and enable merchants to make shipping a breeze [0.99431187]

1055 Accurate inventory counts really help at month-end too [0.9599551]
1065 Their customer support is great also [0.51408005]
1069 Throughout the time working with them we've had a few issues that come naturally logistics but all have concluded positively [0.45298615]
1074 They charge completely wrong (elevated) amounts on shipping to increase their service and then charge your credit card [0.9944133]
1077 Also they have lost a lot of my inventory in B2B orders (so for example that I asked to ship 100 pairs and they have shipped 92 = 8 pairs of shoes they marked as shipped but they were never shipped) they cheat you whenever they can [0.9746283]
1078 Their customer service is HORRIBE: they hire people from India that just reply in templated and do not resolve any issue [0.40293205]
1079 Their customer service phone never answers but what they do really well is to charge your credit card on a DAILY basis with the wrong amount [0.45041132]
1081 They owe me $20K and I guess they will never ever refund that [0.88673764]
1084 COVID has effected some of my shipments which is understandable but overall still having a great experience with them [0.9999208]
1086 Integration with fulfillment and website was very transparent [0.42302695]
1089 Our team at Endurosport interviewed several other fulfillment centers and ShipBob was by far the best customer service we had from any of them [0.47286457]
1090 they worked with us through all the questions pricing scenarios and making sure w could scale to much bigger sizes and internationally [0.6893102]
1092 Very professional company [0.57252586]
1094 Great customer support [0.51416785]
1096 Their onboarding was smooth and sending inventory is simple and straight forward [0.8354886]
1097 I admit I was a little afraid to let go of control of my shipping but all fears vanished quickly and I know I can count on ShipBob to get the job done [0.9957137]
1099 I spoke to several other 3PLs before making my final decision and none of the others even came close to the support pricing analytics etc [0.6257491]
1104 Their customer service has been unbelievable - especially during COVID when everyone is operating at less efficient capacity [0.4949927]
1114 Great company [0.5725656]
1118 Mark our sales rep has been a huge help always on top of things and available at all times [0.96438146]
1119 Highly recommend if you need a reliable shipping partner [0.99508023]
1125 Even in these uncertain and unprecedented times Shipbob has proven to be a trusted partner providing high quality service by processing all my orders on time [0.57574505]
1131 They have been very communicative and have been shipping my orders [0.9880244]
1132 All my 2 day orders have delivered on time [0.91697943]
1135 We had an issue with 2-day shipping on one of my products [0.99545294]
1136 My customer rep (Haley) helped me out all day on a Sunday and also had to involve some team members from the software team to fix the problem [0.50861204]
1137 Needless to say we got the problem fixed by Sunday evening and all orders on Monday shipped correctly [0.9850643]
1138 Worst fulfillment warehouse ever DO NOT USE THEM UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR AMAZON METRICS AFFECTED [0.4593211]
1139 They have super slow handling time orders are never shipped on time [0.97764134]
1140 Warehouse logistics are a mess [0.4206202]
1141 inventory doesn't get scanned for weeks [0.9601572]
1142 Seriously stay away from them at all costs [0.4841602]
1143 1) Handling and delivery way too slow we end up having 3 negative reviews from our customer in 2 months just because of that [0.61799884]
1145 Some of the orders take 15 days to get delivered within the US [0.9152752]
1146 Fulfillment time is slow as well it takes 2 weeks or more to fulfill the inventory [0.9603749]
1147 2) Shipping prices twice more expensive than we had before so our customers end up paying more for poorer service [0.5979963]
1149 We tried and neither we nor our customers like the experience [0.59013253]
1150 If you are looking for a fulfillment partner ShipBob is a horrible option [0.4697896]
1155 Worst of all we lost customers due to delayed orders and faulty tech related to shipping options [0.99256456]
1157 Below are the issues we encountered and based on other reviews and of their own admission I know we are not the only company to face issues like these [0.4648327]
1158 Fulfillment Center Issues: - It is not uncommon for their fulfillment centers to sit on orders causing delays and then falsely claim such delays are carrier-related [0.8559111]
1159 This is true for regular ground orders in addition to expedited orders and we lost several customers who paid for 2 day 3 day and overnight orders that were late because ShipBob delayed processing them [0.90662354]
1160 I should note that all orders I'm referring to met ShipBob's order import cutoff time deadlines [0.9170542]
1161 - They unilaterally increased our box sizes without letting us know which increased the cost of postage significantly [0.96026224]
1165 - On more than one occasion ShipBob sent our customers products from a different company who also used them for fulfillment instead of sending our customers our products which they ordered [0.66148984]
1169 Apparently they only decided to put a returns policy in place in Mid-March of this year 6 years after opening their doors as a company [0.5388312]
1170 Technology and Rate Issues: - They bait-and-switched us on affordable 2 Day shipping [0.99566203]
1171 It took getting one of the company's founders involved for them to fulfill the promises they made and contracted for regarding giving our customers access to affordable 2 Day shipping [0.986916]
1172 - They consistently overcharged us for fulfillment requiring us to do several audits and request credits for being overcharged [0.46521553]
1176 - They offered us "real time rates" for overnight orders that were not actually tied to real time rates; it was a complete misnomer and false promise [0.91523576]
1177 This resulted in us under-charging customers and having to cover the difference which turned profitable sales into losses [0.94566166]
1178 - For a reason they still cannot explain they removed all shipping options and rules and instead put in place a $20 ground option (our product retails for $39 [0.98632896]
1182 3% during the time that our shipping options were affected [0.9957106]
1183 We were not the only customer affected by this issue and because ShipBob never got to the bottom of why it happened they could not assure us it wouldn't happen again [0.51275843]
1184 Issues Cancelling: In the end Shipbob reimbursed us for a lot but not everything and it took nearly 2 months for them to get us our final refund [0.59871817]
1188 The few times that I've had issues with packages not arriving etc [0.921711]
1192 After a year and a half long fulfillment partnership with ShipBob we decided to see if the grass was greener on the other side and switched fulfillment options [0.4710001]
1197 Relinquishing your inventory requires a company that you can trust [0.96072155]
1198 They have great software that allows storeowners complete control of their inventory not to mention their very simple pricing structure that makes forecasting expenses a breeze [0.8822174]
1203 Shipping rates and processing times are very solid [0.9749969]
1206 It was next-to-impossible to find out what my shipment cost for a particular order was without combining data from up to four( [0.9999958]
1207 ) spreadsheets that they'd mail me every week and waiting two weeks for the data to get to me [0.8990559]
1210 So we decided to change our D2C fulfillment to ShipBob [0.4708045]
1211 We got set up in a short period were trained on the software and had our hands held by a customer support rep for the first 30 days [0.51036847]
1213 And we could immediately see what a shipped order cost [0.98961425]
1216 I couldn't ask for a better partner and our customers have been very appreciative as well [0.5896275]
1223 We used ShipBob as our first warehouse in the US and they have been very helpful [0.8515649]
1224 Easy to implement on your site but one thing they can do better is to have more transparent shipping charges [0.9945599]
1225 We use Easyship to ship internationally and I know exactly how much I'm paying BEFORE I ship so I can choose different carriers and shipping methods [0.99568725]
1227 In all fairness they do have a list of costs based on dimensions and weights but it's just not a practical thing [0.4179941]
1235 They also damage inventory and proceeded to charge for storing it and a price-gouging $50/box $/500/pallet to dispose of units that were damaged in house by ShipBob [0.92308474]
1237 They also claim good shipping rates when in fact they are expensive [0.99572134]
1239 I must say that are working hard to resolve the issues which is Avery encouraging sign - they listen to their customers [0.52443725]
1242 Mistake after mistake after mistake - all that cost YOU the customer BIG TIME [0.5170097]
1243 DO NOT BE FOOLED by the nice customer service reps - they try hard to do their job and help but they are powerless [0.46500012]
1244 SHIP BOB is a total RIP- OFF - Inconsistent shipping charges with no explanations - inconsistent storage charges that make no sense - repeated shipping mistakes - they do NOTHING right except smile and make excuses [0.99568886]
1248 Definitely looking forward to continuing to work with them as a partner for my e-commerce stores [0.7560041]
1250 The fulfillment customer service and account management teams have always strived to provide the best customer service possible [0.5028277]
1253 It seems that ShipBob like to remove negative reviews of their company [0.5066665]
1255 From my personal experience ShipBob have made multiple errors with shipping out my goods often charging $35+ to send out a simple product such as a cap [0.99515444]
1256 I have compiled all of the orders with incorrect postage and they refuse to make any refund to my account [0.96031785]
1259 As a customer I understand that sometimes mistakes are made but my frustration is how the issues I have faced have been handled [0.5068821]
1262 The erroneously sent out $20k worth of our products from orders received on inactive products and have accepted no responsibility and literally did nothing to try and intercept the orders that they themselves said could potentially have been intercepted for the ones that were still in transit [0.8806686]
1267 Terrible and slow customer service which has turned over to completely new companies at least 3 times [0.4577481]
1270 I used to mostly ship out of their NY warehouse but they lost probably at least 100 of my shipments it started out as 1-2 lost packages a month [0.99992037]
1273 They “misplaced” on the at least 2000-3000 thousand dollars worth of shipments in 6 weeks [0.9999209]
1278 I just had 10 HUGE boxes of 10 shipped and signed for at their Bethlehem warehouse [0.989335]
1281 " I paid over $800 to ship to shipbob and they are only reimbursing me for the cost of the items but NOT the shipping [0.99341244]
1283 The manager who reassured me so much during last's year's fiasco of lost shipments said I could contact him personally [0.99991834]
1287 Btw shipbob's new reimbursement "policy" is to no longer reimburse for shipping when they lose an item [0.7423523]
1288 What happens is this if they ship an item - it gets "handed" off to the carrier but tracking never gets updated [0.41314068]
1290 Again this used to happen once a month but last summer it happened 10 times or more in 6 weeks - clearly things were getting stolen [0.5923988]
1296 Recently I have seen a huge shift in customer support from all your staff and it appears you guys are letting us treat the Shipbob warehouse as if it was our own [0.5209148]
1297 This is such an amazing experience because I understand the difficulties of trying to balance getting items out on time to compete with the Amazon's but also being flexible and prompt enough to make changes to orders late in the process [0.57852876]
1301 We sent 50 pieces of one of our products to their Texas warehouse to test the ShipBob service in the hope to store larger inventory and more products there [0.8336484]
1302 We currently have 2 warehouses in Europe which we manage ourselves and are familiar with shipping rates and fulfillment [0.99508905]
1303 Now before you get on ShipBob says that the "negotiated the best shipping rates so that you don't have to worry about it" [0.99572223]
1305 Our product is a medium-sized table lamp packed in a parcel with the following dimensions: 20"x20"x20" the products are all packed and ready to be shipped absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item [0.9453874]
1306 Now the average fulfillment cost inside the US for these items is $150 per box [0.51702803]
1308 However the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in Texas to a customer in Dallas Texas [0.92926085]
1310 The shipping had been done with economy ground shipping and ShipBob charged us $80 [0.9957205]
1312 Now for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it [0.99507403]
1313 Just to give you an example: We send out chairs from our European warehouses to customers in Europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp [0.67344767]
1314 A standard shipping fee for this from Berlin to Spain is around 18€ [0.99436057]
1317 The fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $137,9 and now Shipbob charged us $93,6 for the return of this lamp [0.4896091]
1318 That's a total of $231,5 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp [0.9957058]
1321 But $93,6 for a single return of a medium-sized parcel [0.4082041]
1324 There are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates they charge over X10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is [0.99551755]
1325 Just do the math for yourself try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20"x20"x20" and try to get it shipped from one city in Texas to another city in the same state and then try to see how much shipping costs [0.9954698]
1328 Shipping a single box the size of that table lamp that I mentioned in the review costs us about $130 with the express door to door air shipping from CHINA [0.9954691]
1329 How on earth is it possible that Shipbob has rates that are higher for economy ground shipping within the US then express air shipping from China to Germany [0.9957172]
1331 Shipbob shipped this table lamp to a client and it arrived severely damaged [0.989167]
1338 Shipbob also claims to be a US company but only has support overseas [0.44838077]
1339 Very poor customer service and delivery [0.5134051]
1342 Their analytics of delivery does not include processing time and shipping combined [0.9924538]
1343 So they hide the real customer experience [0.51416516]
1344 No way as a customer to get any escalation [0.49082252]
1346 When the virus outbreak hit I had to take all my stock out of the US warehouse as we were out of stock in Asia [0.47604415]
1349 It's been weeks and I still don't have my full shipment [0.9999958]
1351 So much for coming through when you really need to supply in a time of crisis [0.6918681]
1356 Great Service best pricing we've seen and they always go the extra mile [0.6900305]
1361 I wanted to protect my business by diversifying the income stream and use an additional sales channel [0.96781754]
1362 I searched high and low to find a company that could meet my needs of fulfilment [0.41131774]
1365 Their customer service is exceptional and I feel my business is in great hands [0.51135796]
1366 The people of ShipBob are one of its greatest assets [0.41662136]
1372 The integration with our present platform was efficient and easy and the minute our orders were routed to them they were getting fulfilled immediately [0.5796684]
1374 Their customer service is also great [0.50892544]
1379 Shipbob's service and customer care have been world class since I started with them months ago [0.48110318]
1380 I have been a highly challenging and demanding client as I have a growing business that requires international shipping of fragile items and ShipBob have been supportive and patient unconditionally [0.99469227]
1384 I am located in the UK and my client who we connected to ShipBob is shipping products in from Australia [0.9953916]
1388 The pricing is very competitive and I have complete peace of mind with this company and will be bringing more clients to them [0.6749346]
1393 As much of a tech company as it is a fulfillment company [0.624764]
1394 Well funded and investing in state-of-the-art fulfillment facilities and cutting edge tech [0.46097267]
1395 Especially great for use cases where distributed inventory provides a significant edge [0.95474744]
1402 The customer service has been excellent [0.49538785]
1405 Using ShipBob for about a year now support gets back to you within a day prices are pretty great overall -- we are more than satisfied [0.8630235]
1409 So far excellent customer service while we get ready to send our product to ShipBob [0.49864894]
1412 I've been shipping with ShipBob for two years now [0.9957217]
1416 Their prices are worth it and any errors are rare [0.8818812]
1417 In the two years of daily shipping I can count the errors on one hand [0.9957224]
1419 I love the customer dashboard [0.51407224]
1420 Over the years their customer interface has only gotten better and they are continually adding little improvements that help a lot [0.48467642]
1421 I can easily recommend ShipBob to anyone that wants to remove the shipping headache [0.9847803]
1430 It’s 24 hours after signing up and we’re almost ready to start shipping [0.9957205]
1431 Look no further Shipbob is the best E-commerce Fulfillment company [0.90614074]
1432 I am a high volume brand that does thousands of orders a day and the team at Shipbob has worked tirelessly to make the transition as smooth as possible from shipping out of my own warehouse to theirs [0.9945982]
1433 From the pricing support to the usability of the platform it is all spectacular [0.6768919]
1434 If you are a mid to high volume DTC brand I would tell you to for sure partner with them [0.9506616]
1442 Storage logistics and shipping are a huge burden on business operations and since outsourcing to ShipBob I've hardly had to deal with any of that at all [0.9953278]
1445 Their customer service is very engaged and I never have trouble making myself heard [0.5051841]
1446 With ShipBob our logistics and fulfillment is completely covered [0.5915093]
1449 We are growing really fast and with ShipBob we have the option to use more of their warehouses to further reduce shipping costs [0.9956867]
1450 Because ShipBob has a lot of people to handle our orders and additional warehouses we can expand into we can scale up with ease as we continue to grow quickly [0.8587342]
1455 The volume pricing shipping material and labor all come at a significant discount compared to self fulfillment [0.99240905]
1456 We have not had any shipping issues or mishaps thus far [0.9957238]
1457 Fulfillment is timely and tracking is uploaded immediately [0.8986187]
1461 "orders on hold for the following reasons" banner in red on the orders page) [0.8834439]
1465 They have saved us so much money in shipping costs been extremely attentive and helpful and most of all it's a super easy user-friendly platform [0.995598]
1466 Shipbob enabled my business to get up and running in a more transparent and expedited way than Amazon [0.58392423]
1467 Their customer service team (my rep is Nick Hendricks) is happy to go above and beyond and offer white glove service to make sure your products are being shipped on time [0.6072664]
1468 ShipBob has been a great fulfillment partner [0.46963012]
1469 Our orders flow directly from Shopify into ShipBob so it's zero-touch for our team [0.91684186]
1470 There are exceptions of course - for example sometimes ShipBob flags a shipping address as invalid (obviously not ShipBob's fault [0.99401903]
1471 ) - but for the vast majority of orders it's a seamless process [0.8575139]
1474 The pricing is transparent and reasonable [0.6864672]
1475 Fulfillment is like the offensive line of online selling - no one notices it until it fails [0.8753968]
1484 Shipbob is an awesome warehousing & distribution service that is always improving [0.40952936]
1485 Although we did have some issues early on they've improved their receiving order process and their customer service is excellent [0.46887416]
1488 Our first time working with ShipBob for our fulfillment and drop shipment one-off project [0.99999547]
1493 They've made my job much easier and fulfillment much less stressful [0.4730713]
1498 Their TOTAL INABILITY to simply pack a 2-unit or 3-unit multi-pack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering [0.98424435]
1500 And then "that" call was from a warehouse not involved in this order [0.7182561]
1501 They routinely overcharge; orders are placed into OVERLY excessive packaging for one order then into different "appropriate" packaging for the next exact same order [0.9149257]
1502 At times I have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $5-6 [0.5936496]
1507 Emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved [0.6236188]
1508 Typical answer - That order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money [0.88669163]
1510 USD $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money [0.88631725]
1514 Shipbob messed up Shipbob should refund [0.88673246]
1516 "We are unable to refund your credit card" they say (they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they can't reverse a charge - I smell BS [0.8864429]
1521 SHIPBOB are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3-year loyal existing customer [0.513762]
1523 Reluctant to refund that money [0.886612]
1524 Flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs [0.9956121]
1525 This is theft [0.74160707]
1533 A number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing [0.56868804]
1536 As you’ll see all the negative reviews are “verified customers [0.6017009]
1546 They start charging 50% extra charge on shipping 2nd months without notification [0.97544736]
1550 AVOID this company [0.5725227]
1551 The software is poorly designed the customer support is worthless and we were billed thousands more than we expected [0.5140503]
1552 Shipbob shouldn’t be trusted with your mission-critical fulfillment [0.4696835]
1555 1) We wanted a quote to move some inventory from Shipbob last year before the holidays [0.95658493]
1556 Their process for getting a quote is to create a shipping order and write "DO NOT SHIP" for each line in the address [0.9928004]
1557 We did that but somehow they managed to ship our order instead of just giving us a quote [0.93187374]
1559 I don't know where the large shipment of boxes went but it took about two months before Shitbob returned our inventory [0.99999577]
1560 Shipbob's mistake caused us to miss out on busiest shopping season of the year—the entire holiday season from Black Friday to Christmas [0.53528035]
1561 We lost a huge amount of revenue because Shipbob essentially disappear our inventory for nearly two months [0.96146226]
1566 We didn't ship this package to them [0.9488678]
1573 And I have to write over-and-over-and-over again requesting help for the same issues because no one takes any real ownership or responsibility for seeing customer problems are resolved [0.51390773]
1574 Your reps only fire off a quick and useless reply leaving us frustrated and further damaging our business with fulfillment delays and canceled orders [0.79426354]
1575 Day-after-day-after-day I'm spending way too many hours trying to make this work and our business and customer are suffering from it [0.5140042]
1577 These ongoing problems have delayed shipments by days and weeks cost us lost orders creating irate customers and damaging our relationships with partners like Amazon Advantage [0.99991554]
1581 If you can't fix these problems for us ASAP you should compensate us fully for the cost of moving our inventory elsewhere [0.9600532]
1585 Clearly they doesn't know how to create a great company [0.57210654]
1591 To put it in context the number of pallets they charged us for this month exceeds the total number of pallets we've sent them in the years of doing business with Shipbob [0.728028]
1593 Additionally we've had issues with their available box sizes which inflates the volumetric pricing model [0.68562573]
1600 We have had errors/issues with ~20%+ of our shipments they have fulfilled [0.9999209]
1601 For context we have a pretty straightforward fulfillment needs as we sell wholesale and so only need case picks [0.48557505]
1602 Despite this the list of problems is never-ending and includes but is not limited to sending a single unit instead of a case sending another company's inventory to our customers not sending shipments out on time sending shipments under the wrong shipping option (ex [0.99990696]
1603 Ground instead of expedited) overbilling for storage unnecessarily repackaging or case-packed product poor communication between customer service reps and so on [0.5144521]
1605 We have had to spend hours on the phone to get issues corrected and have almost lost customers due to the neverending shipping issues they have caused [0.9951809]
1607 ShipBob became our fulfillment partner about 6 months ago [0.46665508]
1608 They have been the biggest reason why our fulfillment times and costs have decreased [0.54861045]
1610 Their software allows any employee with access the ability to give live updates on inventory levels and locations [0.76166916]
1616 This has saved me lot of time in trying to manually send the shipping information file to the fulfillment provider [0.99292547]
1618 I can also plan my inventory better using this tool [0.9601322]
1619 Here is the cool feature that I liked the most: As the orders increase and more data comes through I can play around switch on and off different warehouses and see the projected shipping rates and average shipping times [0.9956333]
1621 Because now I can figure out what warehouses should I send my product to in order to get the best saving in terms of shipping rates and the best customer experience in terms of average shipping time [0.994896]
1639 ShipBob has been an awesome partner for our subscription business [0.61565113]
1641 Three years later ShipBob is not only handling the fulfillment basics but continually ramps up their capabilities (eg [0.4504584]
1644 We first found ShipBob last year when we looked into third-party fulfillment for an annual campaign that requires shipping a large volume of books [0.99560094]
1645 Transitioning to ShipBob for all of our fulfillment needs has been a literal dream that has freed up our own employees to focus on their day-to-day jobs instead of fulfillment [0.45844138]
1647 We have expanded our relationship with ShipBob to handle ALL of our shipping this year and we are very grateful for their expertise [0.9955114]
1652 I was really impressed with their response and even had the VP of Fulfillment on the phone to address our concerns and give us a resolution 24 hours later [0.6985133]
1654 ShipBob makes order fulfillment simple and easy [0.4730918]
1657 we were mainly intrigued by their simple pricing structure and same day shipping option [0.98819405]
1659 From week 1 of working with ShipBob we started noticing that orders were being shipped as promised their basic 3-7 day shipping option didn't disappoint as it was quick enough for our intended purpose and shipping rate structures I would say in 8 out of 10 times orders were and are still being delivered in under or around 4 days on average from ordering to delivery [0.99541384]
1662 all of the sudden the cost per shipment skyrocketed and it was very inconsistent and totally unpredictable [0.9999958]
1665 I believe it's called "Cubiscan" which is a 3D robotic system that is intended to streamline the fulfillment operation by accurately scanning and weighting any given SKU within the system to be able to give the human picker/packer efficient and accurate data on what is the best and most cost effective shipping label and box size to use when shipping a given order based on its quantity dimensions and shipping destination [0.98981196]
1666 This was obviously designed to make the shipping process faster cheaper and more accurate [0.9955652]
1669 but the issue that when they implemented this system it required all the vendors (people like you and me) to update the nature of their products within the system to basically tell this robot if the product being shipped was fragile stackable foldable or if it required a custom / special box etc [0.81586486]
1670 This was obviously in place to save on "Dimensional Weight" in our favor which is the key metric that determines the cost per shipment with any shipping carrier [0.9999918]
1671 And while this should've been a simple and easy task it led to lots of inconsistency and higher shipping charges in the beginning simply due to the fact that we didn't really know or understood what it all meant and how it would affect the shipping rate [0.9956819]
1672 And so of-course as any wise brand would do we marked every possible secure/fancy option (none stackable fragile custom box) not knowing that this would translate into empty space within any given shipping box which means that if we were shipping a product that is 12x12x12 for example that it would require a much larger shipping box to accommodate the preferences we selected and allow room for lots of packing / padding material [0.99569833]
1673 But bigger box simply means higher cost in the shipping label [0.9957222]
1674 So you can only imagine what it would be like if were shipping 2 3 or more items at once which is typically how we market our products and incentivize the shopper to buy more for the sake of AOV [0.9950023]
1684 Orders are shipped promptly and being delivered in a timely manner as promised [0.4841635]
1688 In today's world where shipment speed expectations and fulfillment costs are high ShipBob becomes a no-brainer for our many eComm clients [0.999995]
1689 Our company is in the music business so having a reliable fulfillment partner that can efficiently get out merchandise to fans is a huge priority to us [0.49470767]
1690 Our business ebbs and flows depending on what we are selling and release dates so finding a partner like ShipBob which allows us to go from a few shipments per day to thousands per day has been a game changer [0.9999208]
1691 They are able to keep up with the ever changing movement that the music industry brings and have been able to take our merchandise operations to a different level [0.5410939]
1695 They also have great customer service and are always readily available to help [0.49375933]
1698 The only thing shipbob is missing is an international presence like some of the larger fulfillment centers [0.4248518]
1700 I recently had a problem with the way things were set up in the backend of Shipbob's website that resulted in several items being shipped out improperly [0.87561864]
1703 Been a happy customer for almost 2 years [0.51413566]
1705 Great company to work with  [0.5440779]
1706 I reached to sales and they own me with the way they treated me and with the product offerings [0.9733496]
1709 I trust the team and trust the company [0.5681121]
1711 We’re a small family owned business out of Southern California that had struggled with keeping up with madness that is e-commerce shipping and inventory logistics [0.99541605]
1712 We’ve been working with ShipBob for the last year now and although we’ve had some slight mishaps here and there The team at ShipBob has always made their best efforts to help get our products shipped safely and in a timely manner to our customers all across the USA [0.96399754]
1717 Everything works as expected - customers get their parcels [0.6591799]
1718 I've been using ShipBob as my fulfillment center since May of 2019 [0.46634132]
1719 To say that switching to ShipBob has been life changing is an understatement - prior to using their services I was literally leashed to my label printer and my house to fulfill orders constantly [0.5079083]
1720 I was absolutely TERRIFIED to switch to a fulfillment service but I knew that what I was doing was completely unsustainable [0.46122226]
1721 Since switching to ShipBob my company's orders have more than DOUBLED - since I'm able to actually put my priorities in looking at the big picture of things rather than doing things like stuffing envelopes all day [0.916487]
1726 Now that we’re working with ShipBob we can easily ship to all 50 US states with ease [0.9463579]
1727 They help us to maximize our shipping and ultimately our growth potential [0.99569833]
1729 We place considerable expectations and pressure on shipping so we can get close to what Amazon does [0.9957009]
1730 With ShipBob 100% of our orders are going out via 2-day shipping [0.995033]
1731 We see that people are far more likely to order and keep ordering from us when 2-Day Express shipping is an option [0.9956211]
1732 ShipBob takes care of our logistics so I can focus on sales [0.9549674]
1733 I cannot imagine trying to run a successful e-commerce company without a strong logistics partner [0.5210004]
1734 Outsourcing fulfillment to Shipbob from day 1 has freed up valuable time concentrate all efforts on different forms of growth [0.47892442]
1736 If your company is small and not yet shipping a good amount of orders every month than you may be better off shipping orders yourself [0.99520457]
1737 Since launch I have not needed to waste any time fulfilling orders and I have been able to spend more time connecting with our customers [0.908304]
1738 Additionally as we have continued to grow we have been able to use the ShipBob analytics to divide up inventory to other ShipBob locations to reduce shipping cost [0.995402]
1742 Incorrect weights on multiple shipments allowing them to charge us more [0.99992085]
1743 After twice shipping items without correct labeling was told we'll wait and see what happens hoping they get lucky [0.99559]
1745 Multiple missed ship dates [0.87590545]
1746 A shipping company that does not know basic shipping procedures [0.99567926]
1749 Do not use this company [0.57094544]
1770 Most businesses concentrate on delivering excellent customer service but these people just try to scrub the evidence from the internet [0.4107318]
1771 PROSPECTIVE BUYERS TAKE NOTE: Shipbob's recent 5-star reviews which suddenly took them from a one-star to four-star company are suspect: They are vague unverified and lack detail - classic hallmarks of fakery [0.4029765]
1783 Shipbob has a great fulfillment center and dashboard but they have two cons (which are important to me and might not be to you) [0.4551751]
1785 Other Fulfillment centers offer this product [0.901036]
1786 #2 They won't push live courier rates [0.98991406]
1787 you need to manually map your rates to Shopify's Shipping Rates [0.9115794]
1794 USPS priority shipment to zone 6 (No oversize etc just a simple USPS shipment normally would cost around $9) They will constantly overcharge you for pretty much everything [0.99999577]
1797 Their on-time shipping rate is close to zero [0.9957085]
1798 Don't expect them to ship anything in a day as they claim [0.9491081]
1800 Even when they mark it as ship it usually won't leave their warehouse until next day [0.9476177]
1801 They outsource their customer support so good luck getting a straight answer for even something very basic [0.49599984]
1803 Company may be great for some but if they make a mistake and overcharge you get ready for a fight [0.57987034]
1815 We had it all they double to triple overcharged us for postage sent our customers wrong items refused to cover for return shipping for incorrect item chose the cheapest shipping method when we paid for expedited take 3-4 weeks to register a return parcel charged us for receiving a returned parcel AFTER charging us for a return label and the list goes on [0.9606768]
1821 Shipbob makes fulfillment as easy and painless as possible [0.4722173]
1823 Very good customer service too [0.5138558]
1824 Great Company easy to work with and very customer centric [0.5165504]
1826 Great software great support good price [0.71999013]
1833 I would like to have pickups on Wednesdays as well as Saturdays in Brooklyn especially during the holiday season [0.656743]
1834 Other than that the packing price customer service has been great [0.8067884]
1839 We transferred to ShipMonk eFullfillment from UPS eFulfillment [0.93987983]
1840 We were concerned that our online store shipments would be interrupted during the conversion [0.9999209]
1845 With everything going on in the world with Covid 19 shipping can be a challenge [0.99568003]
1846 Our account manager with Shipmonk Michelle McCall has been very proactive when trying to resolve issues with our shipping problems [0.9952005]
1858 I submitted a request to label repack and ship to Amazon FBA [0.8906039]
1862 I requested a wholesale order be palletized and shipped [0.9642602]
1863 Their website clearly states wholesale orders will be ready to ship within 2 DAYS [0.5467932]
1865 Their LTL freight quotes were ridiculous [0.98893344]
1866 $492 for 3 pallets to travel 60 miles [0.7258406]
1867 I used my own freight forwarder and only paid $350 [0.8984399]
1868 Do not use their freight forwarder use your own [0.9055702]
1869 Then they charged me $192 to palletize 3 pallets of product [0.7984487]
1870 My second wholesale order they charged me $385 to palletize 6 pallets [0.77065665]
1873 I created 4 wholesale orders and provided them prepaid UPS labels [0.9056269]
1874 They disregarded my instructions and billed me for shipping [0.9957012]
1876 I filed a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back [0.52668554]
1880 I asked for a refund of the second charges but they refused [0.88653034]
1883 50 per carton to slap a label on it and put it out for UPS to pick up [0.9426923]
1886 Three times they asked what I would like done with customer returns that were returned to their warehouse [0.5242539]
1887 I said ship them back to me but I never received any product [0.943594]
1889 They do not provide photos of customer returns so you cannot verify the customer actually returned the correct product [0.5082208]
1893 Don't bother submitting a ticket when a customer package gets lost in transit [0.51702064]
1895 You can't even file the claim yourself with the shipper because Shipmonk has all of the shipping information and they will not give it to you [0.99945897]
1902 Sounds like a bribe [0.8522658]
1909 They will fight you tooth and nail for every single red cent they can get out of you [0.68467516]
1911 If you are doing wholesale orders LTL shipping or Amazon FBA then this place is a nightmare to deal with [0.99555326]
1917 I was extremely excited to begin and streamline my business after talking to the sales agents and researching [0.96553063]
1919 I have now been with them for approximately 6 months and it has been nothing but headache after headache while pouring more money into shipping and website development to accommodate things [0.99557954]
1925 Orders go out on time would highly recommend [0.472809]
1926 I joined ShopMonk after a terrible experience with Amazon and they have been exceptionally helpful and understanding [0.54160285]
1938 They overcharged us $20/day for a pallet when we had a signed contract for $20/month per pallet [0.654615]
1943 They LOST my inventory refund me only 40% of the COST only 40% [0.95284534]
1951 Not only is the customer service TERRIBLE but so was my fulfillment experience [0.5076248]
1952 They offer a nice online system to check on orders but lets talk about the important stuff [0.91484904]
1955 rather than get cheaper rates they are charging you more for every single carrier [0.7595375]
1956 I was getting cheaper rates using ShipStation back when I shipped myself [0.9896358]
1960 In todays world expedited shipping is becoming the new standard and if you are looking to offer that to your -customers MOVE ON TO THE NEXT COMPANY FAST [0.99568135]
1961 ShipMonk's 2-Day shipping cost was so incredibly high [0.99568784]
1964 They offer 'DHL EXPEDITED MAX (2-3 BUSINESS DAY) and I did a report on all shipments that used this service and almost NONE made it there within 5 business days causing me to refund SO many customers that paid extra for expedited shipping [0.99990094]
1965 I prefer USPS priority as I think the prices are fair but they don't offer this for the 48 domestic states only for Hawaii and Alaska which is the biggest joke EVER [0.7706148]
1966 LOST SHIPMENTS: This past year I've lost over 100 shipments with DHL and other random carriers they brought on and they didn't care about replacing these orders or reimbursing those costs [0.99991995]
1967 INVENTORY: I have hundreds of products so this was difficult but I caught many mistakes on our weights and dimensions of products that were WAY WAY WAY OFF which means you get charged more for shipping when you shouldn't be [0.9951539]
1969 STORAGE COSTS: There storage costs are pretty standard [0.4671839]
1972 I wanted a way to see which product was being charged what especially after selling through 90% of the inventory where maybe the product was in a bigger bin previously and now I know it should have been moved to something smaller [0.9595184]
1973 I asked if I could get a report of all my storage costs but they were unable to do so [0.46081102]
1982 That's 35 days of not being able to take sales [0.9749574]
1983 Thankfully - I had our best sellers already on Amazon so I could manually fulfil orders but this is just a joke [0.90651166]
1984 Not only did it take this long to get my inventory picked up they messed up NUMEROUS cartons mislabeling the contents and didn't label my pallets correctly [0.95970607]
1985 I ended up leaving them to go with Shopify Fulfillment Network but if you don't qualify for them I highly recommend ShipBob [0.8433309]
1988 :) Sincerely your customer you never cared about anyways Mike [0.514168]
1991 Great rates fast shipping helpful staff [0.9957237]
1992 Overall a good company [0.5725638]
1997 I also had to talk with my account manager to negotiate some prices and he was super kind and open to discuss the prices to keep us as a customer [0.5665007]
2000 Fulfillment errors are not so uncommon as you'd like at least in my experience [0.9002688]
2002 The good part is that they refund you for those mistakes after you fill a claim but this could happen much less in my opinion because it definitely hurts your brand image if it happens too much (nobody likes receiving wrong orders) [0.88666224]
2016 What a fantastic company [0.5725638]
2017 Not only are they effective and efficient but their customer service is superb [0.50601244]
2018 Really helped us out on a personal level with our business on top of doing an excellent job at fulfillment [0.47401577]
2019 I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this company but my experience has been great so far [0.51234365]
2020 The system / technology work well they automatically fulfill the orders and the people are friendly and helpful [0.8817073]
2022 Their closing agreement that they force customers to sign goes against the constitution and against the 1st amendment right [0.5948411]
2024 They know that nobody would sign when acquiring customers so they do a sneaky thing and force you to sign it at the very end when they hold your products a hostage [0.6225488]
2028 We missed two of our largest sales (Black Friday and Christmas sale) due to their refusal to closeout out account [0.9697721]
2030 They also still charge us for storage [0.7729418]
2032 As an entrepreneur of 15 years I have never worked with such an immoral company [0.56344265]
2033 Earlier posted review: This company almost ruined our ecommerce business [0.46385157]
2039 The customer service was woeful when dealing with Ship Monk and they charged me thousands throughout 2020 when I only had 49 units of stock [0.47363445]
2045 Horrible company [0.5725656]
2046 They refuse to take responsibility for lost inventory [0.96015465]
2047 My carton was lost 3 months ago and they've been looking for it for over a month [0.8355581]
2048 They keep claiming that it was found and then shipped out again [0.9894423]
2050 With a reused shipping label [0.9957213]
2051 You already shipped out someone else's carton and now you're trying to tell me you reused the shipping label and sent it again [0.99569035]
2056 The bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake [0.88647395]
2059 It's very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake [0.5938885]
2060 Here are just a few examples of problems that we've had where they refuse to take responsibility 1) shipping product that isn't our [0.9956107]
2061 we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies [0.63106394]
2063 2) shipping in the wrong packaging: We set-up customer packaging so some of our products would ship in poly-mailers [0.99213064]
2065 For for the past month instead of shipping in the correct package they decided to ship in massive 20X20X12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times [0.9956743]
2066 Now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $7 [0.9416057]
2068 We even worked with one of their VP's to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok [0.5378309]
2069 3)taking months to fulfill wholesale orders [0.8021016]
2073 5) Took 2 months to fulfill e-commerce orders [0.8845059]
2074 We all knew there would be delays during the holiday but as of January 10 we still have orders from Black Friday that have not been fulfilled [0.91370386]
2075 To make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on Thanksgiving that just arrived this week and Shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order [0.63941276]
2079 It's a very shady way of doing business and I don't expect they will be around for long unless they drastically change how they handle claims and customer complaints [0.50493526]
2081 extremely long fulfillment times( over 30 days [0.47310525]
2082 ) lost packages lost receiving and missing inventory(even when someone signed for them) and worse of all they take no resonsibility [0.9194984]
2086 We were in a difficult situation with an already-shipped from abroad into the US multi-pallet shipment and were researching a multitude of warehouse fulfillment choices in the US [0.9999955]
2092 Their employees are mispacking orders and can't follow instructions [0.87776256]
2103 Delayed receiving wrong items shipped misplaced inventory unlimited excuses [0.9609041]
2104 And the blame is always on the courier or something else [0.98892015]
2107 They charge you whatever they want by holding your inventory hostage [0.9601551]
2109 The worst company I have ever come across [0.57252437]
2111 Do yourself a favor and work with a company that cares for you and your customers [0.6567188]
2114 They screw up shipments constantly hugely delay shipments for a subscription business charge insane fees never respond to emails or issues in a timely way [0.99976313]
2127 I currently have orders backed up for 7 days when their expected shipping timeframe is 3 days or less [0.9957003]
2129 "It's a busy time of year [0.7149086]
2140 Dramatic improvement in helping us scale and being on time for customer orders [0.8459419]
2144 All deliveries are done promptly and packages are delivered in the greatest condition [0.99591845]
2146 They broke hundreds of my glass bottle inventory and was not willing to compensate [0.95975274]
2149 Shipmonk is a true fulfillment partner [0.46667883]
2152 We focus on sales and our partner Shipmonk takes care of the rest [0.9740838]
2158 Can not get a refund [0.8867385]
2163 They have really amazing customer service and are always a call away to help us with any issues [0.47053954]
2167 I also like how the inventory section can organize the number of products from least to most which have been helpful for my work [0.9581905]
2175 By far the worse company ever [0.5725619]
2177 They will never take responsibility overcharge you and shift blame every chance they get [0.5814492]
2185 ShipMonk have really helped us store and ship our products out around the U [0.69077843]
2190 Shipmonk has been a fantastic fulfillment service to us [0.4578164]
2191 Their customer service is very hands on and will answer any questions you have within the day [0.46167475]
2193 My experience with their new San Bernardino warehouse has been great and efficient [0.84273607]
2194 As for data tracking they will link straight into your online shop which makes it easy to keep up with your shipments [0.99992085]
2203 Products are shipped on time tracking information passed on instantly [0.93390584]
2204 Pricing seems normal [0.5632334]
2207 You don't have to worry about logistics [0.45328754]
2211 They’ve been a great shipping partner during our growth [0.9956185]
2218 Pricing and customer service and top-notch [0.5761596]
2219 If you're in the drop shipping or commodity shipping business you'll be hard-pressed to find a better partner with as advanced of a tech-stack [0.99568814]
2223 +User-friendly interface +Reasonable shipping prices with many options +Ability to do an extra custom project if necessary +Reliable performance - lack of reporting tools - bit pricy -- when you ship 10 boxes and only 1 arrives they will confirm with a signature that 10 boxes were delivered [0.99498016]
2224 You will never be able to dispute the delivery with the carrier [0.9660809]
2227 I've only come across 1 glitch two already and that's for splitting back-orders which is now resolved- at the time the system wasn't allowing me to split orders but was resolved same day [0.88911796]
2236 shipping Bill's 2x what they should be you will want/need to leave [0.9956646]
2237 At which point they will charge you $2 or $3 for every product left in inventory (that they didn't steal yet) that you want to pick [0.95997745]
2240 How much does it cost you to re-acquire customers after they mess up the shipping [0.9955656]
2244 Shipmonk's customer service is superb [0.5119425]
2251 They took the time to understand my business and needs from a fulfillment standpoint and have consistently delivered on their promises up to this point [0.4750824]
2253 Reliable fulfillment companies are not easy to find [0.48602217]
2257 Their customer service is ok and so is their application but they will kill your startup with their ridiculous minimums and storage fees [0.47363964]
2258 To make it worse they you cannot trust what shipping they quote you they will come back and charge 2 to 3X the original price quoted on the order [0.9929191]
2265 They already charge a premium on storage and they you end up paying 2X that because invariably your storage fees will cross usd 250 (unless you are shipping really small items with limited number of SKUs) and then that would become your new minimum essentially doubling your storage fees [0.9942921]
2266 While they claim this crucial clause was always there on their website (we don't remember reading it) their sales agent never bothered to mention it during the initial meeting we had and it is not in our contract [0.9554567]
2268 Also you would be paying for a whole pallet (X2 because of the minimums) even if you have 1 unit left on it and to make it worse you don't know so you can't do anything about it [0.41661373]
2271 Companies like Shipmonk should go out of business so companies that do care about their customers can do well [0.59803087]
2272 Echo in the line from a review below because we had to deal with the exact issue thousands of dollars worth of lost inventory after they signed for it: "Some examples: They lose inventory upon receiving because they don't check what they sign for when product is delivered to them vs [0.9594201]
2274 So when shipments show as delivered but the inventory is missing from the warehouse their excuse is that they receive too many shipments to possibly try to check what was actually received [0.99991965]
2275 They have literally on multiple occasions lost thousands of dollars of inventory and even when escalated to the CEO refuse to accept ownership of this or do anything about it [0.95957327]
2276 And because they signed the delivery slip you can no longer claim for a lost package from the shipper [0.999588]
2281 Worst company in the history of fulfillment companies [0.72135544]
2282 Their customer service is so poor [0.5062028]
2283 They have overcharged me for shipping and have failed to credit me [0.99569684]
2285 Do yourself a favor and find a better fulfillment partner [0.47315136]
2287 They were always responsive and had affordable shipping rates just make sure you have enough volume to meet the minimum as it can get pricy [0.9957142]
2288 Overall we had a great experience and would use again and does Amazon really need any more money [0.55935043]
2289 At the critical time of year (Black Friday Cyber Monday Christmas) they will only focus on their biggest customers and they will leave you high and dry [0.5879117]
2290 We have hundreds of out of stock orders [0.8795254]
2291 The new inventory was delivered on Wednesday at lunchtime [0.9592299]
2293 30pm on Friday and not only have they not dispatched the orders but they also haven't even put the stock in the warehouse [0.8791807]
2295 The truth is they are focusing on their bigger customers because they pay them more money [0.60083395]
2296 We've been flooded with complaints and are busy issuing refunds when we should be focusing on sales [0.64669174]
2300 The most stressful fulfillment company [0.4977199]
2302 It took them 7 days to ship Black Friday's order out [0.9492413]
2305 If your looking for a fulfillment center that can store and ship your products on time every time ShipMonk’s the way to go [0.54212654]
2307 We thought that outsourcing fulfillment to them would make our e-commerce & wholesale business easier to run but it has been nothing short of a nightmare at every turn [0.48871142]
2308 Shipmonk has good software systems but really really bad processes and the worst customer service (worse than calling your cable or phone company) [0.5061163]
2309 Some examples: They lose inventory upon receiving because they don't check what they sign for when product is delivered to them vs [0.95964295]
2311 So when shipments show as delivered but the inventory is missing from the warehouse their excuse is that they receive too many shipments to possibly try to check what was actually received [0.99991965]
2312 They have literally on multiple occasions lost thousands of dollars of inventory and even when escalated to the CEO refuse to accept ownership of this or do anything about it [0.95957327]
2313 And because they signed the delivery slip you can no longer claim for a lost package from the shipper [0.999588]
2314 They have extremely poor customer service - they literally do not care or do anything to fix it when they make mistakes they make the same mistakes again and again and have no escalation path [0.42525905]
2317 They are ok with direct to consumer but absolutely horrible with wholesale [0.5654579]
2318 It takes 1 week+ to provide shipping quotes for wholesale orders and you have to check on them constantly to make sure wholesale orders actually go out [0.9942662]
2319 They will change the order status to "shipped" and then never provide a tracking number so you have to remember to go back and review all of your orders to ensure they actually went out [0.811341]
2320 They send international orders using shipping methods that get sent back by customs they package products in a way where they get damaged easily and are bad with any kind of non-standard ask [0.9949868]
2321 While some businesses are very customer service oriented Shipmonk is at the opposite spectrum [0.49481836]
2326 In the end you just throw your hands up and say well I guess they've lost a few thousand dollars of inventory again and won't do anything about it and just move on for the sake of your own sanity rather than engaging in another pointless conversation with an enragingly unhelpful agent or executive at Shipmonk [0.959827]
2330 Really BAD company [0.57255626]
2334 From shipping the products doing special projects to receiving wrong prices upfront and explanations on how their pricing working from doing errors of shipping and errors of constuction [0.9916358]
2339 In the end after I cleared off my billing on the website from our bank ShipMonk has lied to us and they still kept that bank connection to us (illegally) and charged us more money than needed and not willing to refund us [0.8810142]
2341 Very rocky start trying to use ShipMonk to fulfill Amazon orders [0.9026206]
2343 Got through it and was smooth sailing (so we thought) until the freight charges started getting "adjusted" by the shipping companies [0.9955411]
2345 9 lb is actually 1 [0.6313495]
2346 05 lb so our freight rates effectively doubled which destroyed our margins [0.9902166]
2349 ) and we've had a number of damaged or lost shipments were the verdict was "the carrier won't pay for that so don't bother claiming" [0.9999206]
2358 I was able to focus on sales and engagement rather than spending hours fulfilling orders [0.9625619]
2359 We have been working with ShipMonk for over a year and overall they have done a decent job in handling our merchandise [0.7195824]
2367 They have made a phenomenal job at Simplifying the entire process from Shopify integration to receiving your products in their warehouses and shipping them globally [0.99498904]
2369 Their international shipping rates are attractive and that has been much appreciated by our customers [0.9956138]
2370 Working with ShipMonk has been a plain-sailing journey [0.7315335]
2373 It was easy to setup great customer service [0.5126862]
2378 - Called us 4 days after receiving some of our inventory to tell us they couldn't figure out what a "few" of the items are [0.95738155]
2379 This was at 4pm on the day our subscription batch should be sent out [0.61569387]
2380 They had not inventoried any of the received product nothing had been done and they didn't attempt to reach out to us [0.74134344]
2381 This delay the shipping almost 7 days - The shipping prices where over 2x what we where quoted not including the pick and pack [0.9956969]
2383 We could have shipped for much less doing it ourselves and have many times - Lots of other issues [0.9896525]
2384 Conservatively lost 20% (could be up to 30%) of our customers due to shipping issues while we used them [0.9942179]
2387 I've had a terrible experience with this company [0.55173445]
2389 After they receive the products they said it would NOT integrate and start charging me U$ 250+ a month and would not return my inventory [0.8011964]
2392 Shipmonk is SCAM - they have stolen several high value watches that were into their inventory and never issued any refund [0.95030254]
2396 Easy setup great customer service [0.5139468]
2397 We used Shipmonk for our crowdfund fulfillment and are now using them for our retail and wholesale orders [0.86543125]
2401 Great experience working with Shipmonk with our Amazon business [0.5744548]
2406 I think the prices are quite reasonable and every person I've talked to there has always been really nice and willing to help [0.89194167]
2407 Ship monk helped us grow our company and was there when we needed them [0.47564685]
2408 I had the worst experience fulfilling my small business orders with shipmonk [0.9161773]
2410 Not only were we being charged obscenely for storage and shipping rates but dropping off and picking up our product was an absolute disaster [0.9957121]
2411 Products were shipped out incorrectly to customers boxes were damaged product was ruined beyond repair [0.9868198]
2413 When we tried to pull the plug on working with them they tied up our inventory for a full month saying we couldn't come pick it up because they needed to pull it all together [0.9600603]
2414 I don't understand how it takes 30 days to put 500 small boxes on 3 pallets [0.82362056]
2418 " The staff refused to help us and instead sat around a table munching on chips watching us struggle with the pallet jack [0.8400556]
2423 Their technology platform is top-notch; I especially love the fact that there is an embedded shipping calculator so you can play with so many scenarios and get pricing [0.94585794]
2424 Oh and their shipping rates are heavily discounted which opens the door for global sales [0.9948163]
2425 Highly recommend ShipMonk for all of your storage and fulfillment needs [0.4696545]
2428 a bright vibrant young fulfillment center not some dingy old Warehouse [0.4739905]
2432 Not having to manage shipping has been a really important part to our company's expansion and we couldn't have done it without the team at Shipmonk [0.9956898]
2433 Their customer service is extremely attentive and all of our customers have been happy with the arrival of their packages [0.5498607]
2438 Two locations in CA and FL can help you optimize shipping costs [0.99523276]
2440 Cool company great dash board fast and efficient [0.5671077]
2443 With them taking over fulfillment it freed us up to focus on running the company [0.56360906]
2444 Their platform is very user friendly their shipments timely and the staff is kind and helpful [0.99991983]
2448 Absolutely AWFUL company [0.46466023]
2450 This company has potentially costs us tens of thousands of dollars [0.56471026]
2451 We used them for our subscription box and they fell flat on every promise that they made us delaying our shipments weeks at a time [0.99897325]
2454 With a MONTHLY subscription box I can't have uncommunicated WEEKS of delay [0.61571383]
2457 We hired Shipmonk to fulfill orders for our startup business on multiple platforms [0.9104957]
2459 Our fulfillment and shipping required custom packing specifications depending on the platform/store orders were processed from and the team was able to work with us on this [0.9931929]
2462 Although our company is based in California we preferred the Florida warehouse to complete our order fulfillment [0.61551994]
2464 If you need a fulfillment company Shipmonk will handle it [0.48115245]
2465 Honestly the best e-commerce warehousing and fulfillment service out there [0.4004984]
2466 What makes them really stand out is their excellent customer service [0.51035124]
2467 Great delivery time and shipping rates as well as a variety of options to choose from [0.99452233]
2472 From that moment on Shipmonk automatically captures the orders from Shopify processes them and then inserts the tracking number once the order has been fulfilled [0.78754145]
2473 So all in all it is a very straightforward process and the only work you need to do is check their interface daily to verify no orders are "stuck" because the buyer entered an incorret address or you have run out of stock of any item (which you shouldn't as they provide a forecast on how many days of inventory you have left at the current sales rate [0.91537154]
2474 All in all very satisfied with their service and the timely delivery of the orders to my customers [0.7625887]
2476 They prepped inventory and sent to amazon [0.95930684]
2481 We do shop updates and during these updates we receive about 1300-2000 orders in a 24-48 hour period [0.42944768]
2483 Here I am a full week after the shop update and not a single f-@%%@ order has ACTUALLY shipped [0.95072883]
2484 All orders are simply marked as pre transit [0.9156684]
2485 Even worse the tracking #s being kicked back into the etsy system are registering as invalid if customers try to track orders externally [0.87941855]
2486 But on top of all of this they have not PICKED OR PACKED a single order in almost THREE BUSINESS DAYS and now I have about 100 orders that are marked late by DAYS to ship or are about to be [0.9479538]
2487 Also I am having to refund people right & left as they say I am backordered on items even though we meticulously counted our stock with a clicker [0.8838792]
2490 The first batch of inventory they right off the bat lost an entire bag saying we had miscounted and only sent 1 bag of a SKU that I had TAPED together [0.6093615]
2491 So here I am with hundreds and hundreds of loyal customers who are pretty upset especially because I had to raise my shipping rates to use this service [0.9951164]
2492 Then to add insult to injury they aren't even shipping chronologically [0.9956962]
2493 So add this to the backorder issue and we are having to refund people who bought things in the very first moments of the sale while folks who placed orders days later get the item [0.87116313]
2494 By now be and my husband would have had at least 1000 orders fully shipped out sure we'd be exhausted physically and emotionally from it but at this point it may have been less stressful than not being able to do anything to help our customers [0.9601601]
2495 Also this was our holiday sale so we now have to shut down our shop early as we are worried any further orders will simply not be processed or shipped in time to arrive [0.9692475]
2496 So I will also be loosing potential sales [0.9747568]
2499 They have consistently misshipped to our customers (literally sending products from their other clients to our customer) created excessive delays in shipping and overbilled us for all of the above [0.9927024]
2503 Never experienced such a great customer service experience [0.5103605]
2507 Pastor Box ships quarterly and I’ve heard nothing but accolades from my subscribers [0.86173385]
2508 Sure the content will make or break a subscription box but if the fulfillment process is not executed with care and attention to detail it would never succeed [0.62511593]
2512 I am a small business owner and preferred to spend time growing my business  so I decided to try Shipmonk as my fulfillment company  [0.5550016]

2539 The tools and dashboard are very simple and easy to use and make handling your shipping orders and inventory very easy and transparent [0.98839957]

2546 Their service is responsive their shipping rates are very reasonable and the process couldn't be easier [0.9911292]
2554 ShipMonk is a very professional operation with excellent customer support (in case you need it) [0.51352733]
2555 The integration automatically send orders arriving on our shopping platform to the ShipMonk inventory platform the only interaction required from us is to decide on the shipping method when that's done the order ships [0.99416]
2556 We decide on shipping method depending on destination [0.99572366]
2557 By teaming up with ShipMonk you have a fully integrated shopping cart / logistics setup which works very very well [0.41173148]
2563 Might I suggest your sales channels would work better if you corrected the spelling of your name built a reputation and stopped trying to annoy random strangers into acquiescence [0.9731064]
2569 We've been using them for around 6 months and are super-pleased with their customer service and fulfillment network [0.47044283]
2570 Really excited to be a beta-tester for international shipping which was a boon for fulfillment of our recent Kickstarter campaign [0.99396914]
2572 Their business model helps them keep costs low and the customer service communication and synchronization with our existing platforms has been seamless [0.49851918]
2575 Deliverr regularly uploading invalid tracking putting amazon act health in jeopardy [0.4047311]
2576 Great customer service [0.50948507]
2581 Outstanding customer service [0.5092798]
2583 Excellent customer service and fast delivery [0.5096583]
2585 Their distributed network of warehouses cuts average package delivery down by more than half [0.75441766]
2586 Most of all extremely responsive with customer service [0.482046]
2589 Fast shipping is mostly on-time and affordable [0.9955615]
2591 Hope to see some improvements in receiving(sometimes too slow & miss some # here and there)/expansion to international shipping [0.99568456]
2593 We switched to them from in-house fulfillment [0.47332734]
2594 While we have had a few lost/late packages we have not had any problems with submitting claims or opening tickets to resolve these/receive credits for them [0.9218777]
2603 On several occasions they delayed our shipment causing us negative reviews [0.9999958]
2604 And now constantly packages are being lost [0.9111091]
2605 I have no idea why they are using DHL for domestic shipments [0.99992085]
2606 We shipped 2 times to a customer and both times the packages were lost [0.9585797]
2607 The customer is extremely angry [0.510269]
2610 We stopped working with them a month ago [0.9019574]
2611 Still stuck with lost packages and trying to figure out what to do [0.921607]
2614 Deliverr has such an easy and seamless process getting set up and orders flowing through for our Shopify and Amazon business [0.8836393]
2616 I appreciate the experience with my sales representative as he was always ready to assist me [0.9747774]
2620 Thank you to the sales rep at Deliverr [0.9604136]
2621 We've worked with amazon's FBA rakuten logistics and I can tell you w/o a doubt the support knowledge base and tech aggregate into this shipping company has created a stack no e-com can do w/o [0.9950478]
2627 1: Shipping fee: calculator is off from your real charge I have evidence calculator: $5 for 0 [0.9713138]
2630 2: Arriving late: over 50% of orders are delayed arrive sometimes are lost 3: Removing inventory is extremely expensive [0.9524239]
2633 By turning these on I was able to see a 400%+ increase in sales which was stunning [0.9719604]
2646 Any fulfillment inbounding or technical issues were immediately addressed by Deliverr support [0.46820414]
2650 I had a great customer experience working with Archana Somasegar and also with Shawn Sprauer [0.51315343]
2652 We are using Deliverr since Aug 2020 for fulfillment of our Walmart's orders [0.8861475]
2656 You only need to ship your products to their warehouse and save time on all aspects of fulfillment [0.5561903]
2658 Deliverr is very efficient and cares about customer service [0.5058413]
2662 For example it provides free "WISH 2 Days" shipping and begins the fulfillment 2 or 3 days later and still charges you $7 [0.99485624]
2663 5 for this shipment [0.9999958]
2664 This is really absurd and I have had customers complained exactly about this [0.5492508]
2670 Not only is this added manual work for us but sometimes the Deliverr platform doesn't let you cancel orders that are "packed and ready to ship" even though they are 3 business days delayed already [0.8945344]
2671 Now we're forced to decide whether to risk double shipping an order or get dinged for a late ship [0.9956588]
2672 This means those customers will get two shipments and have the option to return one of the shipments for a refund [0.9999111]
2673 Unfortunately there is a high cost of removal from Deliverr so we're held as a hostage until we sell out what we have of our inventory there [0.92884207]
2676 We're switching back fulfillment to our third-party warehouse instead [0.48436502]
2685 I don't usually write reviews - but this was an exceptional customer experience [0.51412153]
2690 We recently sent in a few pallets to Deliverr for two of our brands [0.75951886]
2691 Both brands are now fulfilling just about all online orders through Deliverr [0.9099095]
2692 Without a doubt Deliverr's customer service interface and rates have been unparalleled [0.4550611]
2693 We have multiple reps reviewing our account on a daily basis offering suggestions and solutions to maximize our fulfillment performance across all channels [0.43049556]
2695 I'm eager to shift more of our business to Deliverr and rely on them as our #1 fulfillment provider [0.44055295]
2696 We started setting up Deliver in late November and had our first shipment out in January this year [0.99999547]
2697 Tiffany from Deliverr has been excellent and the customer service provided was top notch [0.44987765]
2700 We have a good experience so far they are -professional and their fulfillment cost is lower than many other fulfillment companies [0.471902]
2708 We hit a point where our limiting factor was not the number of potential sales we could capture but the volume or orders we could physically get out the door of our warehouse [0.9727686]
2709 Partnering with Deliverr makes it much easier for us to support a significantly higher sales volume get customers their products faster and limit liabilities associated with shipping all of our products from a single location [0.9866239]
2712 Not only are they proving to be a stable fulfillment partner which allows us to support higher sales volume but the many integration features are helping us on the marketing side as well [0.88316965]
2713 We are able to get several customer touch points in place to help customers make purchasing decisions with more confidence [0.5329731]
2716 Since we started using Deliverr  our volume has gone way up  while our shipping/handling expenses have gone down [0.96934956]
2717 Customers love the 2 Day delivery tag that comes with using Deliverr [0.93053764]
2719 Their customer support team is somewhat slow in response time though [0.5109091]
2724 For example: - Orders over Cyber Monday took 2 weeks to ship out and almost got canceled by Walmart [0.48755264]
2725 Despite what Deliverr claims this still hurts your Walmart delivery metrics [0.9663774]
2726 - They are CONSTANTLY losing inventory now - both inbound and inventory in their warehouse [0.96008366]
2728 This is happening for 30-50% of orders lately [0.91155225]
2732 - They don't add any bubble wrap or protective packing to boxes [0.8870191]
2734 Absolutely indefensible for a reputable fulfillment company like them [0.52213115]
2738 I was selling close to 200 items a week November and December and Deliverr did a great job filling those orders [0.56333506]
2739 I they took the stress out of shipping for me and my customer received there product in a timely manner [0.9729153]
2742 We grew our volume with them 7x during 2020 in the pandemic [0.9687399]
2744 They are the first company - even before Walmart or any of the other incumbents - to succeed in creating a viable FBA alternative [0.4715615]
2747 No refunds [0.63616884]
2749 The receiving time for inbound shipment takes months [0.9999958]
2754 New warehouses are frequently onboarded and offboarded causing inventory to be unavailable for weeks while moved from warehouse to warehouse [0.9618934]
2757 I do not trust inventory levels and canceled orders for stockouts frequently occur without fast alert (email takes 2+ days to let me know an order has been canceled) or visibility into why an order was canceled [0.95526785]
2763 I can't wait until I sell through my inventory with this terrible company and can sever my relationship; I do not trust they can accurately remove my inventory [0.9579957]
2772 Deliverr is constantly innovating with new fast shipping delivery options on increasingly more marketplaces making it so easy to expand discoverability [0.99502844]
2776 Our Account Manager provides us with a very high level of tailored customer service and is constantly looking for growth opportunities [0.44612548]
2779 This year they have been especially vital in helping us diversify our fulfillment options which has allowed us continued growth in an unprecedented year [0.47916338]
2781 30 Percent of my packages were lost in transit my items weighed 7 Lbs and they placed it in a bag to ship [0.8373778]
2784 They are always shipping packages out late [0.9952432]
2786 Since we signed up in October Deliverr has cost us thousands of dollars while losing 1/4 of our inbounded inventory [0.95994556]
2788 They're STILL INBOUNDING after a full month of having our inventory [0.9601612]
2790 I feel bad for her because she has to do the work of this awful company [0.5688931]
2798 As we needed to branch away from Amazon [0.5691079]
2802 Our products have smallish profit margins and they were the only company that was able to make self fulfillment worth our while [0.5087428]
2806 Everything ships same day if placed before 2pm EST which is amazing [0.6931637]
2816 I want to use Deliverr however this company like many others do not have any phone support [0.61479425]
2817 I want to talk with a representative at the company before I spend money with them [0.55964947]
2820 If you can't have any conversations with a customer there is something very wrong with your business plan [0.51384443]
2823 Their on time shipping is 85 [0.9956714]
2825 that's only 381 orders in the last 20 days [0.9169735]
2828 The onboarding and inbound shipping process are smooth and seamless also outbound delivery is fast and on time [0.9564297]
2830 For a multi-channel seller this is a huge benefit [0.8062312]
2833 I decided to go with Deliverr because their pricing was unmatched [0.6894301]
2834 Their service however is even better than their pricing [0.64754796]
2835 I was up against a deadline to get thousands of orders out the door and my shipment was delayed at the port Damian and Johnny worked with me tirelessly to make sure the product got received in and shipped out as fast as possible [0.9999954]
2838 I just signed up with Deliverr and I love the software and customer service [0.50696814]
2839 I have a wonderful rep Paige who guided me through the process of packing my inventory and getting it out to their warehouses [0.9572731]
2844 This is the worst company I ever dealt with - its been more than 2 months that I have been emailing them back and forth about the number of packages they lost in transit and these guys behave like shameless people not to bother about anything - they have been asking me repeated questions again and again - first they asked for the invoice which I gladly shared now they are asking me for BOM - why on Earth do I need a BOM to prove that I shipped the inventory to them when they themselves agree that they lost track of the count [0.81648904]
2846 I wish I knew this all before even starting with them - PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR VICTIM TO THEIR S**T SERVICES - They will keep charging you for the storage costs even when you ask them to remove/dispose your inventory [0.9595808]
2848 After researching a ton of fulfillment solutions we landed on Deliverr because of their great pricing and integration with key marketplaces offering 2-day shipping [0.9871917]
2854 Talking about 3weeks plus delays and all they will tell you is 'they are investigating' My goods were to be shipped in boxes as per agreement but they kept shipping in polybags causing damage [0.9951254]
2857 ( got less returning customers from their side) [0.5904156]
2859 Pretty common for orders to remain hanging after they have been marked as fulfilled [0.910084]
2860 I'd only realise after some chargebacks hit me or refund request emails from customers [0.88567835]
2875 Great service - good shipping rates [0.99235773]
2878 Wish they had better rates for multiple piece shipments [0.9999209]
2883 Our company signed up with Deliverr to mainly increase sales on the Walmart [0.9606946]
2885 We immediately observed an increase in sales with the 2-day delivery tag [0.97539157]
2886 The fulfillment fees for Walmart orders are fair and we are satisfied with the service [0.530923]
2890 Our growth manager has been consistent about checking in with us and helping our company thrive with Deliverr (Thanks Tyler [0.45237973]
2892 Second they support multi-platform with the same inventory [0.9599572]
2896 Shipping has been generally good but there is definitely room for improvement [0.97359157]
2897 Also customer service is our responsibility [0.49879903]
2898 FBA is convenient since customer service is provided but I understand why Deliverr cannot provide customer service on our behalf [0.49298945]
2900 They also have a lot of webinars that educate our stakeholders and show some cases that we can improve our sales [0.7649983]
2905 With the current situation online we found ourselves blocked from Amazon and sending inventory into FBA [0.947769]
2906 Deliverr allowed us to find a back-up solution that works well with other marketplaces and sales channels [0.89036554]
2908 The only cons are that some of the carriers partnered with Deliverr have a tendency to lose shipments [0.9999207]
2909 But this could also be attributed to the increase shipment numbers of 2020 across the board [0.99999577]
2910 The other problem is that having a third party fulfill our orders increases a harder to resolve customer service questions as most customer service questions revolve around fulfillment [0.45210528]
2912 Overall Deliverr is a headed towards a 5 start fulfillment service and is definitely a major asset to multi-channel fulfillment [0.46342406]
2913 We moved from Amazon FBA to Deliverr we are now using multiple sales channels [0.93673486]
2914 Emily Callahan has done an excellent job of onboarding our companies inventory and fulfillment needs along with referring us to key sales channels [0.70617104]
2916 My orders are being fulfilled in a timely manner [0.9144264]
2918 Thanks again to Alain Hillary and Moses in customer support [0.46750876]
2921 From the start the Devlierr team has very helpful with the on boarding process and through our first shipment to their warehouse [0.99999577]
2923 Compared to Amazon's customer service Deliverr's is orders of magnitudes better [0.5024153]
2926 Everything from their transparency and easy to understand pricing model easy setup process and incredible on-boarding support [0.64606583]
2927 I worked with Fulfillment specialist Shawn S [0.90103316]
2932 In under 2 weeks I setup my Deliverr account sent shipments to Deliverr signed up and went live on Walmart Etsy Facebook Shop and Shopify [0.999919]
2933 Prior to using Deliverr I only sold on Amazon [0.58230704]
2947 • Apparently customer support closes on the weekends [0.51329434]
2955 - To date we have sent in 2 inbound shipments each to 4 different fulfillment centers [0.9999205]
2956 The receiving has been relatively slow (1 to 2 weeks) but all items have been eventually received with no errors or missing inventory [0.9443672]
2957 - Deliverr has shipped out to numerous customers using ground expedited and Walmart 2-day delivery [0.9676831]
2958 These shipments have all gone out either same day or next business day [0.9999209]
2959 We also sent some test shipments and the packages all arrived in good condition [0.9999208]
2960 A small issue is that the packaging used varies from warehouse to warehouse and there is no packing slip or invoice included [0.8205992]
2963 We are now selling on Walmart with free 2-day delivery [0.97433263]
2964 Overall it has been a very positive experience with Deliverr and specifically with Shawn Sprauer and I can fully recommend them to other companies looking for a new fulfillment partner [0.43956587]
2965 Good idea but bad software coupled with mediocre customer service support [0.48143116]
2970 Everyone is forced to use the main master account which include sensitive billing info and other user functions that the shipping manager does not need access too [0.9213433]
2976 Deliverr's software does not allow you to untie a sales channel integration [0.7328125]
2977 So if you integrated a sales channel with a Deliverr account [0.9042063]
2983 and I had already integrated my sales channel to the account [0.9615911]
2986 Ready to start sending in goods and becoming a paying customer [0.664033]
2992 The standard protocol for Deliverr's customer service is if they do not have an answer for the customer they will just ignore them [0.4907902]
2994 It is a simple and cost effective method for shipping across the US [0.99570477]
3000 Deliverr if you are reading this your company has so much potential [0.533307]
3001 PLEASE invest in a live customer service team [0.40433186]
3002 You are killing us with the current lack of support for your customers [0.59011203]
3003 Tyler gave me some great help today in regards to moving my product sales forward and updated me with everything that Deliverr has in the works [0.9555393]
3009 Your professionalism customer service skills and business acumen confirmed that I made the right choice in selecting Deliverr as my fulfillment and shipping service [0.75922096]
3016 We are (were) a $2 million company trying our best to manage and weather the COVID storm [0.42981732]
3017 With supply chain and fulfillment understandably locking up at Amazon we were turning to new vendors to assist us for our B2C deliveries from various channels [0.9692248]
3021 that sales rep simply "ghosted" and refused to approve the promotion [0.9722228]
3022 Really bad business and pretty harsh customer service - especially given the hurdles we small companies are all facing during the economy changes [0.5054477]
3023 What a lost opportunity as we would have turned around and referred then to all of our network of company owners [0.55333143]
3026 The 'true' heart & soul of a company shows when things go out of the ordinary [0.5650762]
3027 With the current Corona crisis the shipping world is - obviously - haywire but not Deliverr [0.9956597]
3031 We've used Deliverr to fulfill our Walmart Marketplace orders since late summer 2019 [0.9106736]
3034 I am continuously looking for ways to grow my business with Deliverr and am confident they are the perfect fulfillment source for us [0.45982885]
3036 Their platform is very intuitive and their customer service is very responsive [0.5118115]
3046 Getting our inventory set up on their platform was a piece of cake [0.96011436]
3047 The Deliverr platform is intuitive and easy to work with - just the right features to enable us to manage our inventory schedule shipments monitor invoices and payments and manage integrations with marketplaces [0.998093]
3048 So far we have scheduled both UPS and LTL pallet shipments; both were easy to schedule within the Deliverr app and everything arrived quickly and appeared in our inventory within a few days of scheduling [0.9457744]
3052 We have already noticed a noticeable uptick in our sales and conversion rates on both our own website and marketplaces like eBay and Walmart [0.6222886]
3059 Comparing to Amazon/Walmart seller support these guys are great to work with [0.873348]
3060 I put off setting up fulfillment by Deliverr fearing it would be difficult and time consuming [0.46379298]
3075 Deliverr has been great to work with and they offer competitive pricing especially for 2-day shipping [0.99262387]
3079 They made getting set-up and managing of our marketplace fulfillment a breeze so we can now focus on digital marketing [0.46545115]
3085 Deliverr is the new kid on the block of shipping services and it gain traction as a great solution [0.9935825]
3086 It's main advantages: 1) It gives you a quick shipping badge / 2 days shipping / etc [0.9957223]
3087 This increases conversion and sales of your products and you can see it almost instantly [0.94912696]
3090 It's much easier to use Deliverr to create orders fulfill orders and even inbound shipments [0.99991363]
3095 Just last month they added an option to inbound all shipments to one location (Before you had to send it to 4 different locations) and it's improving every week [0.99992067]
3098 We are using Deliverr to handle our Walmart orders and our website orders [0.8301479]
3101 Even tho it has only been a few weeks now we have seen a great improvement in sales [0.9747885]
3109 We are using Deliverr to handle Walmart orders this is new startup and they are growing super fast there are hickups here and there  but those guys at deliverr working 24x7 to make sure to handle all problem arising  will definitely recommend this business for your fulfillment needs  [0.74202275]
3120 Deliverr has quickly become a major player in the Fulfillment world [0.8988994]
3121 Their rates and ability to deliver packages in 2 days make them a no-brainer when trying to offer Fast shipping on platforms like Walmart [0.9877588]
3125 I now send orders 2-day shipping for less than it cost to send standard anywhere else [0.9945877]
3126 I not longer have any angry customers asking where packages are (they always arrived in time) and the conversion rate on our website went up significantly when we added 2-day shipping [0.99341846]
3127 I really think everyone should be using Deliverr it will boost your sales and customer satisfaction [0.7002688]
3130 They’ve improved their service a lot over the last year offering freight forwarding and reducing minimum quantities [0.9801263]
3135 Great company [0.5725656]
3142 2-day delivery has been a huge factor for conversion [0.96479183]
3145 It is more than simply a delivery company [0.7788546]
3146 We use it for the fulfilment of our orders and the company is like an agent who will receive items package it and deliver it to our client [0.7834703]
3150 They offer a lot of extra perks if you do Walmart and Shopify fulfillment with them [0.46780896]
3152 Deliverr has definitely helped increase our sales on Walmart and have been an excellent addition to our shipping operations I highly recommend them [0.994498]
3155 Deliverr genuinely wants to help grow sellers sales and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to grow their e-commerce business [0.9056832]
3156 Deliverr is a great resource for online-retailers that need fulfillment through Walmart [0.44786176]
3159 A fantastic choice for your Walmart fulfillment [0.47286522]
3164 com revenue with 2 day shipping [0.9956503]
3168 Shipped goods over 5 weeks ago [0.79661256]
3169 Still didnt arrive to West coast [0.47827762]
3170 Bigger Issue- none of our Walmart orders are showing in Deliverr [0.91625196]
3177 As Deliverr do not own these warehouses resolving issues with the partner warehouses take lot of time [0.9578496]
3178 I sent my inventory on time to meet the deadline provided by Deliverr but still could not get the item in stock in their warehouses to be available for BFCM sales [0.96854514]
3183 Helped me expand and increase my sales on Walmart in a matter of weeks [0.9327216]
3190 I have had several delays in shipments over the last week and they won't respond for at least a day which is a big deal when the customer is promised two-day shipping [0.99989086]
3193 " No positive resolution for the customer which hurts our business [0.5151657]
3195 Great 3PL great customer service our account manager was very helpful getting us on board [0.5141701]
3197 I attempted to send in a critical mass of my items to get the ball rolling but had to send in more than I wanted -- with Amazon FBA I would typically send in 2-3 units of a new item whereas here it was a minimum of 10 per SKU (now down to 5) and then as soon as a couple of the units sell you lose your Fast Tag shipping tag thus defeating the purpose (the only way Deliverr can meet the 2-day shipping requirement is by having units near the customer so if you have units in stock at Deliverr but not at enough fulfillment centers you lose the tag) [0.98434556]
3202 Now I have to pay again to get all my items shipped back to me [0.743763]

3268 We shipped 2 times to a customer and both times the packages were lost [0.9585797]

3363 It was actually a better cost saving for us to go with Coshipper which got us the best price and A1 service [0.7024535]
3367 Are there hiccups sometimes yes but honestly if you've been in the import and export business for any reasonable period of time you'll know that these guys are at the top of their game and offer truly something really different [0.97368085]
3368 Been a private label seller since 2015 [0.8794109]

3418 Coshipper always does the sourcing (yes they helped me find some products and contracted out to the factories directly) and the logistics part of shipment of our products to Amazon warehouses straight out from China + splitting shipment to a few of my client's large warehouses (for further distribution) in the US [0.99999565]
3420 Are there hiccups sometimes yes but honestly if you've been in the import and export business for any reasonable period of time (8 years for myself) you'll know that these guys are at the top of their game and offer truly something really different [0.9694672]
3422 My advise to some is to make sure you get the best packaging possible at the manufacture side and to make sure QC is done before you ship out or else its very hard to find the ones accountable as your distributors or end customers are gonna complain to you if and when truth hits the fan [0.5068087]
