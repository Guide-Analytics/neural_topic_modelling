0 I feel that this is a very viable tool for advertising [0.96090347]
1 It is economical and reaches people that are seriously looking for places to rent and not just hooky loos [0.99422365]
2 We get a very good return on our investment and I have recommended this to my friends [0.9934742]
3 I have travelled to over 79 countries stayed at every posible hostel/hotel/ guest house and I have never left a review for anything in my life [0.9785388]
4 But today I’ll make an exception [0.99564385]
5 It’s funny cause I read reviews and the all agree on two things: 1 [0.909223]
7 ANDREW the owner the worst of them all (see reviews here but especially on Yelp about him) [0.57841474]
8 What a terrible experience [0.9807028]
10 Anyway these people are not worth more than this minute it took to write this [0.9774672]
11 4 [0.9521325]
12 4 on 235 reviews is a lie [0.57723427]
13 Their own employees wrote this [0.98983717]
14 Go to Yelp and check there [0.74405694]
16 Stay away from this company [0.88026756]
17 I was renting a studio through Airbnb for one month [0.96942663]
18 There was a strong paint smell in the room [0.9962379]
19 I did not notice when a staff is checking me in because I was wearing a alcohol sprayed mask when meeting her [0.84694177]
20 Then I left right away for work [0.9982534]
21 After returning to the apartment after work I found this place smells very toxic [0.9714777]
22 The friend who helped me moving in had a feeling of nauseous [0.846336]
23 I had to move to my friend’s place because it was late night and I do not want to risk my health [0.97877103]
24 Also when we left the shower curtain in the bathroom fell while my friend was pulling the entry door [0.97889066]
25 The place is not at all safe for living [0.9855098]
26 Then I reported the issue to Plan A but I was unexpectedly mistreated by them [0.9976811]
27 They denied there is any safety concerns in the space claiming that the room was inspected and the smell is non-harmful [0.9983734]
28 But once you are breathing in the room YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THEM [0.5331573]
29 Also they had a very aggressive attitude while negotiating [0.9901839]
30 They questioned my intention of reporting since I did not mention this issue when checking in [0.97887856]
31 But by that time I was wearing a mask and could not smell [0.9912358]
32 What I could do was to report as soon as I realized it even if it’s after checking in [0.98257905]
33 Plan A believed I just want to receive my refund by reporting [0.97877806]
34 However I PAID FiRST [0.9705914]
35 If I do not want to spend money why would I make a reservation at all [0.99713945]
36 They kept saying they will try to dispute my case so that I do not get my refund even telling me that my friend “unfortunately offered me a bad solution” [0.9765366]
37 It was indeed personal attack [0.99422383]
38 Stay away from this company [0.88026756]
39 They are sophisticated on dealing with legal issues and you will lose on debating with them even if you do have a reasonable statement [0.9244166]
40 Airbnb processed my case for about 10 days but the result came out that I do not receive any refund [0.9787913]
41 But still I will not stay in their place for that I lost my trust on both this company and Airbnb [0.9787234]
43 People or their employees are paid to write it [0.43840638]
44 They also turned off the rating on Airbnb platform maybe because there are too many complaints [0.9983429]
45 My property was rented within 3 days of posting it through Plan A Real Estate [0.98101306]

347 That's a sign I made the right choice [0.9696366]
349 Very rude and hard to deal with [0.7609588]
351 And they also try to extort extra money and leave you with the bills for maintenance if they ever get around to it [0.9886122]
352 And if they don't they will blame you again for not calling the maintenance guy to fix it [0.9890319]
353 The units were not liveable and very dirty if you bring anything up to them they get very aggressive towards you to make you feel like you did something wrong [0.55620867]

359 The team worked closely with the mortgage lender to ensure that all legal requirements were satisfied and the loan was cleared in time for closing [0.49874002]
360 Although we mostly communicated throughout the transaction with his’s team who manage day-to-day operations he was present at the closing [0.96732897]
361 He was very organized and efficient that was in stark contrast to the seller’s side [0.99111384]

399 He's always available and attentive and makes us feel like family [0.8836888]
403 The realtor helped us buy our first home [0.88550663]
404 We could not decide which agent to go with but when we met him at an open house we immediately hit it off [0.9941846]
405 He is very quick to respond overly attentive and has a great sense of humor [0.974309]
406 As first time home buyers the process felt daunting and overwhelming at times especially in a crazy market like LA but he made us comfortable every step of the way [0.9881204]
408 We could not recommend him more [0.9941847]
411 It was our first time buying a home and they were with us every step of the way [0.9940666]
412 When we found issues during the walk through they negotiated on our behalf and were tough when needed [0.9944809]
414 Our experience was good at the beginning I'm writing this review from me and my partner but also my brother who was renting the studio next door [0.9608935]
416 On the other hand the building was poorly managed and the people working there had NO clue what other colleagues in the real state were doing [0.8891365]
418 A week after moving in someone called us to do the "move in inspection" when we were already living there [0.8855463]
419 Weird [0.9060579]
420 Also when my brother moved into the other studio it was filthy and they didn't do anything about it [0.9788917]
422 Some people are told that the amount taken will be according to the time invested in cleaning but sometimes it's not the case [0.9815792]
423 But if the place was that dirty I guess the people who lived in that studio before him was charged an outrageous amount of money but they didn't clean the place [0.9955616]
424 During our time renting through Plan A they would inform us about an inspection or other things and they were NEVER on time [0.87512106]
425 They were late or wouldn't show up at all [0.9983675]
426 They are not reliable [0.99833465]
427 The man and his office provided excellent service demonstrating professionalism and personal attention to all details of my upcoming agreement toward the purchase of a new condo [0.43551978]
428 His attitude to the work she does not only saved my money at closing; it also helped me to avoid other problems a potential home buyer cannot foresee [0.9616899]
429 Normally we don’t even think about such problems ahead [0.97836375]
431 I am the one who purchased a new condo half a year ago with his help [0.9696047]
433 I had been working with another company for 3 MONTHS [0.9739648]
435 I contacted Plan A Real Estate for a quote on loan rate and how long it would take to close [0.96737367]
436 He got me approved right away and closed without a glitch [0.8563755]
437 He beat the other company's rate too [0.9914461]

458 They are rude aggressive people who have dirty broken bug infested units [0.9982563]
460 Only real reviews for this place are the 1 star reviews [0.5772014]
462 They have all fake 5 star reviews just go read them its hilarious how bad they are [0.64770275]

511 I have discontinued all other media advertising of our single family units [0.9671972]
512 I ask Plan A Real Estate to “show me the money” and they did by reducing my staff time significantly [0.97424823]
514 The approval process was quick [0.9722964]
515 A Real Estate the owner recently represented me and my husband in a real estate transaction and it was quickly evident through working with him that she is knowledgeable experienced and respectful [0.71339256]
516 During the process he spent ample time with us to walk us through the process and ensure that we understood what was expected of us [0.89773995]
517 I highly recommend them and look forward to potentially working with them again in the future [0.97868544]
518 The sell rep has been inspecting our house for the last 3 years and has always been a pleasure to work with [0.9274012]
519 What I really appreciate is that he remembers us and takes the time to ask about how we’re doing he’s a great reflection of the company [0.98248684]

533 So I know a top real estate pro when I see one [0.99907863]
534 The man from Plan A Real Estate is one such realtor in this area [0.9025815]
535 This is a good site for a tenant looking for a good apartment [0.98879]
536 - Airbnb's in buildings that don't allow them putting guests in danger of being kicked out at any time [0.9752939]
537 Reported to Strata and building authorities [0.89957273]
539 But have the audacity to yell at you on the phone shamelessly claiming they did [0.9831085]
541 - Their reps have no sense of hospitality yet want to conduct business on Airbnb [0.88219553]
542 Someone needs to inform them that Airbnb is not a leasing platform but a hosting platform [0.49182427]
543 They openly drop F-bombs on calls with you and only respond when threatened to be reported [0.9561137]
544 Their accounting rep even had the audacity to vocalize to me that she did us a favor by assisting us shift to another unit of theirs that we were forced to shift to because of their inability to maintain the plumbing hygiene of the one we were in or timely respond to our communications for assistance [0.9856231]
545 Only at the threat of reporting did they come running scared [0.91259]
546 - They try to do showings of units while you are in them as Airbnb guests and do not provide any notice whatsoever [0.97040164]
547 I had to send away 2 viewings in the mornings [0.96964824]
548 That too during a time of Covid [0.998976]
549 They don't see humans [0.99839455]
550 They see $ [0.99839467]
551 - After seeing (real) Google reviews about them along with (real) Yelp & Airbnb reviews we consider ourselves lucky as we escaped without losing any money but did lose a lot of time energy and sense of security at their hands [0.5800046]
552 - The megalomaniac heading this operation needs to be Googled for just 5 minutes for one to understand what kind of character he is and the "company" he is running [0.9129448]
553 That being said the unit we Airbnb'd from them was very pretty but it's a shame that their lack of ability to maintain these pretty units is proving to be a harrowing experience for anyone that dares to live in them [0.9988048]
554 Steer clear friends [0.6928424]
556 Watch now as they respond with either "Fake review never dealt with this person" or provide falsehoods to nullify the above [0.6817918]
557 Sorry Plan A we know your type and were sure to collect an overwhelming amount of evidence to match our claims [0.7144499]
561 I was referred to them at the Plan A Real Estate and I was really impressed with their professionalism and the great investment opportunities they able to show us [0.42553604]
562 Looking forward to building a long and successful business relationship with them [0.8822236]
563 I rent 2 months in 1283 Howe St with Plan A [0.969625]
564 They were not professionals (almost everyday some one of the company went to my place showing other people) even if I was at home [0.9788576]
565 That apartment is 600sqft when I left the place they charged me 350 dollars about the cleaning which means 12 hours of service [0.99891615]
566 I don’t recommend their service and won’t stay with them again [0.9683622]
568 From the moment she came to my house she was up front about everything including a hard work that was ahead of us [0.9784981]
571 The units will be dirty and they will be very aggressive towards you till you can't handle it and are forced to move [0.99738264]
573 Very rude and unpleasant to deal with [0.76109225]
574 Also all the 5 star reviews are fake [0.57733953]
576 I have been working with Plan A Real Estate on a few occasions and every single time they are truly A++ [0.975183]

580 Loved working with this company [0.97538096]
581 The process was fast & smooth [0.968588]
582 The "loan guys" were very attentive & extremely patient [0.9470751]
584 They are renting properties they are supposed to be selling as short term rentals [0.9983945]
586 People with this type of behavior shouldn't be allowed to operate in our city [0.967652]
587 They will extort you if you are not careful make sure you have receipts [0.84706515]

591 We will be recommending you to friends,family and look foward to working with you in the future [0.994175]

618 The agent was good did everything well contacting was good and assisting in the final phase of signatures [0.9782623]

655 I have to assume that some of the other less favourable reviews are from competitors or disgruntled ex-employees [0.8355832]

657 It is an excellent company to do business with [0.9942131]
662 Very happy with their services [0.81102324]

680 Few days later new tenants moved in the apartment next door a plan a rental as well [0.9200598]
681 These tenants were horrible partying all night smoking all kind of stuff [0.9838415]
682 Once again many complaints to the rental agency were met with disdain and mockery [0.99932724]
683 After 4 weeks we were exhausted and decided to move out [0.9498477]
684 Off course we did not get our deposit back [0.8899743]
685 It seems from all the reviews that you can say good by to you deposit the moment you sign the rental lease with this company [0.9940457]
686 It sounds almost like a scam operation than a honest business [0.9936402]
687 The reviews on yelp seem to be more guanine than the fake ones they keep posting themselves [0.5798508]
688 To have an idea on how bad is this company reputation just google “greed eviction” [0.7173234]
689 We wish we did our research before giving our deposit to these unscrupulous people [0.99417466]

721 Our rental experience from this company has been quite traumatic for our entire family [0.9596575]
722 All this happened more than 6 months ago I was reluctant to post a review [0.9698573]
723 However after seeing all these fake 5 stars reviews poping up all a sudden I feel it is my responsibility to alert other potentials renters about what they are embarking in when dealing with this company [0.97504646]
724 Nearing the term of my pregnancy I wanted to have my mother coming from Sweden to be by my side [0.978862]
725 We decided to take a rental for her closer to our place for 3 months [0.99418247]
726 We found a place advertised by plan a real estate [0.9941847]
727 During the showing the place did not look at all as the pictures advertised [0.9311831]
728 The furniture's looked old and very used the whole place was smelling sigarettes and all sort of dirt on the floors [0.98510915]
729 I was assured it will be all cleaned before my mother moves in [0.97879267]
730 We signed a 3 months lease [0.9941846]
731 The day my mother's arrived she went traight to the place from the airport I received a frantic call from her [0.978605]
732 I went to see what it was all about the place was even dirtier than when I saw it the first time [0.96962744]
734 I was told the place was cleaned [0.9696522]
735 I took pictures and I went to their office to show them that it was not [0.96949995]
736 As soon as we arrived we were told if there is any complaint we have to talk to the owner anoop [0.98909587]
737 That what we did we explained him the situation and showing him the pictures [0.998976]
738 His response was quite puzzling "if you want a clean place go to a 5 stars hotel" [0.9459729]
739 When insisting that we paid for a clean place the F [0.9946962]
740 words stared spuwing out of his mouth [0.9754365]
741 My mother and I were in chock [0.98101306]
742 During our entire life in Sweden and here we haven't been in a presence of such a vulgar inscrupolous and shady individual [0.89051193]
743 He refused to give back neither the deposit not a portion of the first month rent and on top of that they charge us cleaning fees using our credit card they had on file [0.96310323]
744 We just forfeited everything because we did not want to deal with this individual anymore [0.9941842]
745 It was not worth complicating my pregnancy for [0.99269795]

747 And don't trust these fake stars reviews they are all paid for or from his staff [0.5079553]

758 I emailed them so many times but no response or action made by them [0.96925044]
759 It was so frustrated and irresponsible [0.9942237]
760 Also they have been charging me $150 per month but posted the parking spots at the same location for $125 on Craigslist [0.84526443]
762 Hands down THE WORST rental company I have ever encountered in my life [0.97883755]
764 Just google "greed eviction" and you will have a glimpse on what to expect when signing a lease with them [0.7519881]
765 Also have a look at the reviews on Yelp and Facebook one common complaint is how unclean and bad smelling the apartments are [0.59002966]
766 The second complaint is that more likely you will never get you security deposit back [0.54074305]
767 They prey mostly on international students looking for short term rentals [0.9983862]
769 The worst real state company ever [0.98551553]
770 Such a group of thieves starting from Andrew the “manager” [0.9957818]
771 Who has no clue of customer service or even know how to talk to one of the tenants [0.8962753]
772 They charge you for damages without giving you any proof even though you ask for it [0.9736805]
773 So people be ready to get a lawyer once you decide to sign a contract with this people because things will get bad [0.9990819]
774 Like me I am already working in a case against to them because the fact that I’m not canadian doesn’t mean that I don’t have rights like Andrew’s said to me [0.89650553]

1157 Ben's calm demeanor and organization were critical in my over two and a half month search for the perfect property [0.9782069]
1158 His knowledge of the market is unsurpassed as evidenced by other agents actively listening and asking questions when Ben would describe development in the area surrounding any given property [0.9381322]

1180 When we relocated from the United States to Canada for work we were overwhelmed [0.9913066]
1181 Our company that moved us did not educate us on what needed to be done for immigration schools and neighborhoods properly [0.9601714]
1182 We found Ben Kay and he was more than an incredible agent [0.9941848]
1185 I told Ben on the day we signed for our condo that once he is no longer our condo agent I will make sure he becomes our good friend [0.96792126]
1186 And that he is [0.99064094]
1188 Ben really took the time to get to know us personally and to understand our wants and needs in finding our first home [0.9206532]

1198 Ben Kay and his team were a real pleasure to deal with on my first home purchase [0.97893983]
1199 Having no prior experience with buying a condo I was a bit reluctant at first but Ben assured me that everything will be just alright [0.44562617]
1200 And it was [0.9906408]
1201 And it still is [0.9906406]
1203 I highly recommend his services to any one looking to acquire their next piece of real estate [0.9651915]

1206 And hard work it is for all [0.9897702]

1209 Ultimately my Vancouver Island raised husband Mike and I acquired a beautiful condo for our retirement in a few years [0.9964245]
1211 And just to mention maybe most importantly he makes it obvious that he loves what he does [0.99059033]
1214 I bought my first condo this year [0.978782]
1215 I am not going to lie; at first buying my first home seemed a tiny bit overwhelming [0.9788301]
1216 However once I connected with Ben and he became my agent he helped me navigate the process with ease and confidence [0.96959066]

1236 ONE DAY with Ben and we are SOLD [0.9202995]

1242 We still miss his regular daily updates during our search [0.9896407]

1280 He took his time with us and never rushed - always provided detailed explanations to any question we had - from basic to the really complex [0.6825952]
1281 He is very meticulous in going through all the strata paperwork which I can't say about many other realtors - Ben saved us a huge headache in potentially purchasing a condo in a building with a hidden structural problem [0.6404912]

1297 doing those two will speak for themselves [0.8064482]

1307 I feel 100% confidence in referring Ben to any of my clients looking for Vancouver Downtown condos [0.96826535]
1309 Advent takes exceptional care of my condo rental [0.9788917]
1310 They found a great tenant and ensure that everything is maintained cost effectively [0.99768984]
1311 The rent is collected and paid to me like clockwork [0.8465025]
1312 At one point I forgot I owned an investment property as Advent does an amazing job of managing it for me [0.8167906]
1315 He knows the building well and the neighbourhood as well [0.9914482]
1316 Also offered to let us view similar suites and other amenities that is in the building [0.88451636]
1317 We hope our offer for the rental will go through [0.9941845]
1318 This company was great until there was issues between the neighbors [0.98879313]
1319 The lack of response from the manager has led the issues to escalate [0.5646076]
1320 Normally I don't go out of my way to write bad reviews but I feel I should share my experience here as I often look to reviews myself and I had read the reviews on Advent before renting from them and liked what I saw [0.9681813]
1321 Also before I go further I will expect to get a reply saying "call the office" or denying that there are any issues as has come with all the other negative reviews on here [0.88327044]
1322 I am renting a basement suite from them on a property that has another basement suite  a laneway and a four bedroom space upstairs [0.96959823]
1323 The complaints my neighbors and I have had had been fair requests that were outlined in our agreement [0.9793414]
1324 There's been an unreasonable amount of noise all through the night from other tenants garbage in our yard and the alley that has been left by them not to mention a few weeks of dog poop left in our section of the yard when they have a full front yard to themselves [0.8999455]
1325 The sound and garbage issues have been happening for over 2 months [0.9797931]
1327 It's a shame because it has been fine otherwise [0.9597275]
1329 Otherwise it's upsetting and frustrating how they push the issue around I'm assuming that they're expecting us to give up [0.99959487]
1330 I don't appreciate being woken up by other neighbors multiple nights and by their smoke alarms going off and taking my recycling out to find all sorts of garbage just dumped out there and blown around the yard [0.9787238]
1331 As mentioned if the issues had been properly taken care of and there was some sort of enforcement of management with Advent I don't think these would have escalated [0.98949414]
1332 This morning our power was out because Advent didn't care to discuss the change with BC Hydro when they took over the property and I missed an important meeting and as a result lost money [0.988724]
1333 Again I don't like to go out of my way to write such negative reviews but I wanted to share this information as I feel such disrespect and lack of care from Advent [0.97443026]
1334 It could be our assigned property manager specifically but in that case it reflects on the company [0.99423605]
1337 A few items to consider I am aware that smoke alarms are for safety [0.96314055]
1338 The smoke alarms were going off at 4am 3am mine were replaced recently so I assume it was due to being wired to the ones upstairs [0.9697609]
1340 The garbage has been blown around in the yard there was a bag left in front of my front door plastic all in the compost multiple times [0.97889525]
1341 I was not notified that a new bin was ordered and I'm glad to hear it [0.9824225]
1342 Although there could be a millions trash cans added it won't help the lack of sorting the general mess and the garbage left around the lane and our yard by the other tenants [0.9904054]
1344 I have no reason to take time to write this review if it wasn't true [0.9701015]
1345 I am frustrated with the lack of care from Advent and this is why I'm sharing [0.9695493]
1347 Honestly my process finding a rental placement agency was painful at first [0.9986975]
1348 The majority of companies I contacted didn't call back or took days to get back to me [0.86636]
1349 When they got back to me the interactions didn't inspire confidence [0.8668638]
1350 After calling 7 companies I called Advent [0.969674]
1351 Within a day I spoke to a friendly secretary [0.9695099]
1352 She addressed my needs and after connected me to Jason Wong [0.9646336]
1355 During our first face to face meeting Jason was pro [0.8859324]
1357 He handled taking photos posting the listing promptly handling tenant screenings and going on site for tenant viewings [0.9947054]
1358 After each viewing Jason called to report how it went [0.80088896]
1359 After a few viewing we setup a meeting with two interested parties [0.88402593]
1361 Biggest thing for me is Jason Understood my tight deadline to rent due to leaving the country [0.97619766]
1362 He went the extra mile finding me and excellent tenants in the 11th hour [0.8895506]
1363 👏 It been a year plus and I'm very happy with how everything turned out [0.99413216]
1364 It worked out so well I referred Jason to my business partners who had the same excellent experience [0.74570084]
1365 Quality tenants rents paid on time and good customer service [0.6750765]
1367 Monika is great and helped us to get our new apartment [0.8853259]
1368 She is great and recommend her [0.9514093]
1370 I have been working with the Property Managers at advent for over a decade now they manage my investment condos at the River District and the Olympic Village [0.9788777]
1371 They placed good tenants and they go out of their way to maintain a good relationship with them they give me updates when any expensive repairs need to be done and give me peace of mind every step of the way [0.8237567]
1372 Any time I have had a problem it has been quickly resolved [0.9692084]

1376 Highly rated in my opinion [0.9788917]
1377 My tenants have been first class and the service is most professional [0.9809205]
1379 They've been around for a long time and know the industry inside out [0.9878146]
1382 I was shopping around for Property Management companies as I had a bad experience with a realtor that placed a terrible tenant in my property so I figured it was time to use the services of licensed professionals instead [0.62777835]
1384 I was impressed by the knowledge and professionalism of my property manager and even more impressed by the efficiency in placing a tenant [0.40387365]
1385 There is a night and day difference in using Advent vs using a realtor that is a 1 man show with no support staff [0.95105934]
1386 I recommend using Advent’s services with no hesitation [0.94025284]
1388 Michelle and her team have managed my rental properties for the last 14 years and I can say with no question that they are the right people for the job [0.97502536]
1389 Michelle has an in-depth knowledge of the rental markets and the residential tenancy act which gives me a lot of peace of mind [0.67650443]
1390 It’s good to know my properties are in safe hands [0.97889453]
1392 If you’re buying an investment property there’s only one company to call to rent it for you and that’s Advent [0.99657565]
1398 I rented my home from Advent years ago and they’ve been excellent landlords - they always take care of the repairs and seem to run an efficient ship [0.9787457]
1399 No complaints here [0.8742281]
1400 I would recommend their services to other tenants and landlords [0.96808165]
1401 Been very happy with the service they provided me for over 3 years however the Covid-19 pandemic sure caused an hiccup but what a service recovery [0.8555648]
1403 I am amazed how fast you both responded and restored my confidence in your company [0.96242064]
1405 I will have another suite that will be available soon and will be reaching out to you Liz [0.9530618]
1406 We have several properties managed by Advent the team is very responsive to our requests and the communication is great [0.9937692]
1407 They have many systems in place to insure that our properties are occupied by quality clients/tenants [0.98999614]
1408 We feel that we are well looked after and as we bring on more properties we will turn the keys over to Advent [0.9941843]
1409 Their fees are very reasonable and well worth the peace of mind [0.9896094]
1411 I have left a lot of google reviews in the past but none like this where I feel an obligation to share my experience with Advent as a warning to others [0.8510913]
1412 As a property owner who was shopping around for property management companies to hand off my property to I found Advent to be very unprofessional and rude [0.9761696]
1413 They also tried to convince me to be willing to rent my place out for much less than what it is worth [0.9740293]
1414 From scrolling through other people’s reviews I notice the owner responds to most negative comments with either telling people to ignore the defamation or that the reviewer does not exist in their system; hence I am providing a very detailed review of my personal interactions with Advent [0.9258057]
1415 I have a 1 bedroom + den (650 sqft) around Broadway/Commercial that I was looking to rent out and was considering handing it over to a property management company [0.9702796]
1416 I spoke with an Advent employee in Business Development at the end of Aug-2020 (I have records of who it was but I will not name her in this review) [0.96998036]
1417 The conversation started out fine until I asked how much she thinks my apartment can be rented out for [0.9788203]
1419 I told her one of my deciding factors of whether I want to hand it off to a property management company was how much they might list it for because an assessor from the bank had given me a rental estimate [0.97456944]
1420 She asked how much it was assessed at and when I responded with $2100 she suddenly got very hostile and aggressive saying I will not get more than $1700-800 for my apartment [0.9786919]
1422 She went on to say that for $2100 people can get a similar place in downtown so why would anyone want to rent around Broadway/Commercial when they can be in downtown (for someone that keeps mentioning they are licensed and is an expert in this field she did not seem to realize not everyone wanted to live downtown) [0.9484664]
1423 She went on to ask how they came up with such an absurd number and I said the assessor pulled rental ads from nearby similar properties and that the 1 bedroom in the rental building next to mines has it listed up to $2300 [0.9727877]
1424 She got more agitated and ranted about how that is not the proper way to set a rental price [0.97154653]
1425 She continued to tell me $2100 was an unreasonable ask by saying the brand new low rise nearby (name The Victoria) has 1 bedrooms for $1800 and asked why would people pay more for something that is similar to mine but is brand new [0.8570912]
1426 She then went on to pull up the rental listings at The Victoria to try to prove her point …  I did as well and we saw that for $1800 it was a 450 sqft studio she was trying to compare mines to [0.9720755]
1427 At that point I felt like I was talking to a novice with a poor attitude so I thanked her for her time and hung up [0.9696393]
1428 While shopping around for a property management company I posted my apartment for the $2100 and had multiple applications for it [0.9784845]
1429 I ended up renting it out at $2100 within 2 weeks of this incident [0.9697061]
1430 Most other property management companies I spoke to said my place can rent for $2100-2300 and were very professional [0.97169083]
1431 I personally would have gone with Birds Nest Properties if I didn’t find a tenant by Oct [0.96965086]
1432 I highly recommend all owners to get an idea of what their rental property can go for before speaking to Advent because my feeling of them is that they are a volume business and their goal is to rent out your place as quickly as possible so they can start collecting the 8% monthly fee and that they do not care about getting the best rent they can for the owners [0.80566967]
1433 A $300 difference in rent is ~$300 more for the owners but 8% of $300 is just $24 more for them [0.94996285]
1435 We had some terrible tenants that were unresponsive difficult rude etc [0.99418443]
1436 The property manager has handled and is still handling the situation with back charges for bylaw fines that were issued by strata due to the tenants lack of responsibility [0.9418907]
1437 We feel the property manager went above and beyond to help us through this difficult process [0.99415916]
1438 We highly recommend them [0.9941846]
1440 They’re the right people to use for management services for sure [0.7508148]
1441 I wish I’d used them from the get go instead of placing my own tenants - it would have saved me a lot of hassle [0.9754596]
1445 Monika was fantastic and went the extra mile for us [0.88458216]
1446 One of the worst rent management company to deal with [0.6332152]
1447 You don’t get receipt for any charges they invoice [0.54130685]
1449 I don’t recommend [0.9695327]
1450 One of my friends rents here and my company also works with Advent as cleaners for some of their listings [0.9788734]
1451 Their agents in field and staff in office are always so pleasant and easy to communicate with [0.87935364]
1452 We highly recommend them [0.9941846]
1454 The service used to be good but my most recent experience has been very poor [0.63350636]
1456 Got pushed back and forth between multiple agents [0.9696828]
1458 I rented an apartment with Advent over 3 years ago I recently moved out and can say undoubtedly that I would rent from them again and would recommend their services to home owners too [0.9697965]
1459 They were accommodating for all of my service requests when anything broke they fixed it quickly when I lost my keys they helped me out with the Locksmith scheduling and more [0.9747926]
1460 If I owned a property I wouldn’t hesitate to rent it with Advent because I know they pay close attention to detail and actually “manage“ their rentals as you’d expect a professional company to do [0.97171146]
1461 Thumbs up [0.91767323]
1463 Rentwithadvent website is useless [0.8916307]
1465 If the rental ads are no longer valid look to remove them or automatically reply to people that it's not available otherwise your wasting people's time and shows unprofessionalism [0.46984404]
1466 I worked with Michelle and her team to rent my home and really can’t say enough good things about  [0.9789957]
1470 Especial thanks again to Michelle & Donald [0.90879154]
1471 I highly recommend them [0.9694741]
1472 I got value for money with the professionals at Advent especially given today’s market [0.9657761]
1474 They placed excellent tenants in my rental property at a good rate [0.9790235]
1475 Emails took 3+ days to answer and when I called the office to understand what the communication issue was I was told tenants are a dime a dozen and I did not matter [0.68833894]
1476 After applying for an apartment that we loved in which I had a wonderful 45-minute positive conversation with the landlord the agent told us the application was denied by the owner [0.9251907]
1477 After contacting the landlord to see what we could improve the landlord informed us the agency had denied the application [0.61926115]
1478 From the start I had a hunch the agency didn't like us due to my diligence and interest in the apartment but never did I think they would deny the application [0.9783682]
1479 I truly believe the application was great and the apartment was a great fit for the landlord and for us [0.9653222]
1480 Very disappointed in the unprofessionalism of the company and how they have dealt with this process [0.9553478]
1481 I expect a rental agency to streamline the process for the landlord and tenants and Advent only got in the way of that [0.980908]
1483 With my busy work schedule advent had took the stress of finding renters and going through the background checks and showings [0.96780866]
1485 I highly recommend Advent [0.96906996]
1487 Advent is the go to company if you want no headaches [0.5408244]
1488 Michelle Farina is one of the best brokers in the business [0.77722496]
1489 I'm so thankful that she's always a phone call away for anything related to rental management contracts and tenancies [0.7481045]
1491 I always refer my clients to Advent as I trust Michelle's team with her foundation [0.97186875]
1492 My partner and I contacted Advent about viewing an apartment [0.98101276]
1494 So we rebooked for later in the day and everything was great [0.99908227]
1495 The second apartment viewing was rescheduled due to snow again understandable [0.981788]
1496 However the property manager never contacted us to reschedule despite multiple emails from both myself and my partner [0.9635594]
1497 Finally the third apartment viewing was booked and confirmed but the property manager never showed up [0.43501613]
1498 I waited for 45 minutes called them texted them and emailed them but received no reply [0.9549376]
1499 I called the office to speak to a manager was told that they would look into it and get back to us but have yet to hear back from them 2 weeks later [0.9535576]
1501 We have found better luck with more responsive property management companies and will be reluctant to trust Advent moving forward [0.9941277]
1502 Edit: The property manager followed up apologizing for the misunderstandings and mentioned new options for rentals available but at this point my partner and I had found an apartment [0.9785581]

1519 I didn't realize how much work houses really are until I rented mine furnished [0.9699546]
1520 There really is a lot going on with houses [0.9962247]
1521 I'd find it very hard to manage everything myself and I'm so thankful for my agent and the staff at Advent taking care of everything for me [0.97044986]

1529 I highly recommend them if you’re shopping around for rental agents [0.9692473]
1531 My realtor referred me Advent as we needed a rental agent to manage our place while we’re working away [0.9810043]
1535 The following was my post from last year and i see no reason to change any of it [0.97893035]

1547 I had the joy of dealing with Linda Danielson [0.97014713]

1560 I signed up with advent for their property management services over 6 years ago [0.9469643]
1562 They take the stress out of renting which is much needed whilst I’m working over seas [0.9977551]
1563 Working in the industry for 6 years I have come across a number of members of the Advent Team most recently Brad Thompson [0.91177934]
1564 With equally challenging jobs his efficiency and attention to detail help us both address the concerns of our clients [0.5683654]
1566 We have rented with Advent since 2012 [0.9941847]

1572 Advent has managed my properties for about 7 years now and we have always been very happy with their services including finding good tenants for us [0.9781547]
1574 As newcomers we were blessed when meeting Kevin Ho from Advent [0.98905575]
1576 Even when we do not have history as renters in Vancouver we perceived a notorious difference by the way we were assisted by Kevin [0.98691714]
1577 He helped us through the whole renting process explaining deeply every step and helping us to solve our needs in time [0.9048788]
1579 We strongly recommend Kevin Ho’s rental consultant service to our friends [0.99418163]

1582 The next time I am looking for a property to rent I would hope that it is listed on Advent as I know they take exceptional care of their clients [0.70909446]
1584 I found a listing that was of interest and reached out to the agent [0.9703573]
1585 She replied to me with a list of questions as well as request for my preferred times for viewing the suite [0.95643467]
1586 I got back to her right away and provided 3 different times/day the week following that worked for meeting her at the building [0.98279923]
1587 I work from home so my timing is quite flexible [0.9788045]
1588 It took her 2 days to reply back and when she got back to me she wrote: "Thanks for getting back to me are you available for a showing on Tuesday December 11th at 12:15pm [0.9893637]
1590 " Okay I understand this point but then why bother to ask me my preferred times if it didn't really matter [0.99714804]
1591 As it turned out the timing she proposed interfered with a client meeting and when I inquired if any of the other times I offered worked she never bothered to reply back [0.9902991]
1592 Brutal [0.9127866]
1593 A couple of weeks later I noticed the unit was still available so again I reached out [0.96965694]

1601 I would never recommend Advent to anyone [0.9695566]
1602 Lousy response time and lousy service [0.6598074]

1607 He provided us with responsive and efficient communications and overall top-of-the-class service [0.9396107]
1608 We were able to move in to the new home within one week after reaching out to Kevin [0.99418455]

1734 I highly recommend Jaime and Advent [0.9685777]
1735 It's a no brainer Jordan Macnab The Macnabs [0.97354144]
1737 They got me to sign bad tenants and then thy wanted to charge extra for handling the eviction process [0.86754584]
1738 As soon as it became too much work for them they virtually vanished and I had to call from a different number each time to get in contact with them [0.88044226]
1741 The only time I was ever able to communicate with Brad (Property Manager) was when I first signed the lease papers and provided the damage deposit [0.8564122]

1748 They quickly found us fantastic tenants and everything has been running smoothly ever since [0.8712542]
1750 I was in a rush to find a place after moving to Vancouver for work and I don't think I ever waited more than a few hours to get a response from them [0.9708037]
1751 I was really interested in one of their offers and they worked with me to get my application approved quickly so I could move in when I needed to [0.97463554]
1752 When I was moving out they worked around my schedule to handle key drops showings and other details and were very transparent about what they needed from me [0.72372323]
1754 The rental agent refused to accommodate timings that were not between the hours of 9 to 5pm Mon to Fri [0.71413964]
1755 Those are the exact timings I work [0.97182536]
1757 I had to call the office and forward the call to her in order to talk to her [0.96891373]
1759 I work in healthcare I can hardly take lunch breaks [0.97071993]

1762 There were NO PREVIOUS TENANTS [0.99623513]
1767 I've been renting from them for just over a year and everything's been fine [0.98475116]
1770 Fantastic rental agency and property managers [0.40184534]
1772 Going with Advent to manage our properties was the best choice and have helped us above and beyond [0.90253574]
1774 As a tenant using Advent was the perfect solution to the hazards of the Vancouver rental market especially the uncertainly and risk of having to deal with a private landlord [0.9880963]
1775 I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Advent to anyone [0.96950763]
1777 My wife and I own a small rental property that we bought new [0.9810132]
1778 We decided to handle renting the property ourselves so went about doing the necessary work to ensure we got a good tenant [0.99432003]
1779 What a disaster the renters were late on their rent payments 10 out of 12 months and it took 2 cleaning women 5 hours to clean the 500 sq [0.9825745]
1782 We found being landlords was way to stressful and so hired Advent to do the work for us [0.9939451]
1783 Absolute best move we ever made [0.9202973]
1785 We have used Advent for over ten years [0.9941847]
1786 I tried to schedule a viewing for two properties that were listed by Advent [0.9456077]
1787 One was in Dolce (Private Collection) and the other was in Olympic village [0.9375883]
1788 I didn't get a response back for the first inquiry so I contacted Liz again [0.96939075]
1789 She responded with a longggg application to be filled prior to the viewing [0.96406263]
1792 In fact on the voice message they very directly say that if you leave a voice message they won't call you back [0.41800445]
1793 We ended up finding another apartment [0.9941847]
1794 I would never get these guys to list my property [0.97887945]
1795 The unit we wanted to look at was listed for almost 2 months and they even dropped the price but we couldn't even go see it [0.9839238]
1796 In our apartment search we came across many rental companies and they all went out of their way to accommodate a time that would work for us and actually tried to sell the place [0.8944416]
1797 Maybe these guys are too busy and don't have the time to show their apartments I don't know but whatever the reason it's pretty hard to rent out a place if you're not willing to show it [0.99619055]
1798 The guys at Advent are always there when I need them they respond to my emails quickly and take care of any repairs in a timely manner [0.97644997]
1799 So happy I rented with them [0.9990817]
1800 Probably the best property management company in town [0.90616447]
1801 I’ve tried a few different rental companies over the years and none of them come close to providing the level of service that Advent does [0.6983319]

1806 I have worked with many property management companies cover the years and my experience with Advent has by far been the biggest let down of them all [0.6155624]
1807 I viewed two of Brad Thompson's apartments and though I didn't end up taking either listing I wanted to commend his customer service and recommend working with him if you're looking for an apartment or home [0.97223455]

1810 A great company to deal with [0.76768994]
1811 I highly recommend them [0.9694741]
1812 I have referred clients and also used them for myself [0.85464054]
1814 I've been renting with them for nearly two years and have so far had no problems [0.9866519]
1815 They always address concerns and problems swiftly [0.9980187]
1816 I do not recommend Advent to anyone [0.9694661]
1817 This company is very dishonest [0.9887929]
1818 I rented my condo from Advent and my experience has been very positive [0.9700667]
1819 The customer care staff always help me out whenever I need something fixing and their receptionist is bright and friendly when I call their office [0.7550747]
1820 I’ve dealt with all different landlords and real estate agencies before but definitely Advent has topped all of them [0.9601953]
1822 Look for Kevin Ho or Michelle Farin  [0.9418919]
1825 I removed my review because after I posted it I received a phone call of verbal warning from the agent Brad Thompson that the company is taking legal action because of my review on Google [0.9783151]
1826 The persona that I see responding to these reviews on behalf of the company is not what I feel is accurately represented in person when I went to their Hamilton St head office to discuss why I was threatened with legal action [0.9594904]
1827 The Agent and the woman at the head office belittled and bullied me [0.8506568]
1828 Big bully [0.4903082]
1829 100% I left crying [0.9696522]
1830 I have worked with Advent Real Estate Services now for approximately 7 years [0.96931463]

1860 She cannot own up to her mistakes and beats around the bush [0.8822467]
1863 Maybe nice for owners but terrible experience for tenants [0.99572146]
1868 I would never recommend it to anyone [0.96962297]
1869 I have had multiple dealings with Advent and I have nothing but positive things to say [0.96625406]

2378 Kris Loncar was easy to work with sincere and very accommodating [0.8162265]
2379 great service [0.6869582]
2381 worst company ever they are not allowed to do short term rentals but they do and also give you copied fobs that got me in trouble with the manager of the building the manager deactivated the fobs so I was stuck outside in the cold for over 4 hours and the agent would not call me back because he knew he was in the wrong [0.8615237]
2382 over prices as well and bed bugs in the units [0.7801111]
2383 The entire team took such great care of me from the moment I called to inquire about a property for rent [0.71136683]
2386 I constantly recommend Matt to friends family and anyone looking to rent from any of the Vancouver Property Management Companies [0.9583554]
2387 (Translated by Google) after buying a property through Matthew we decided we also wanted a real estate investment in downtown Vancouber [0.91237634]
2388 His knowledge is essential and he advised us to buy a one bedroom apartment [0.9579555]
2389 He runs it for us and we couldn't be happier (Original) dopo aver acquistato una proprietà tramite Matthew abbiamo deciso di volere anche un investimento immobiliare nel centro di Vancouber [0.8968491]
2390 La sua conoscenza è fondamentale e ci ha consigliato di acquistare un appartamento con una camera da letto [0.9030573]
2391 Lo gestisce per noi e non potremmo essere più felici [0.9035151]
2392 I wish i knew the showing agent's name but we booked an "appointment" for one of Tracy's listings drove half an hour to get there and there was a huge line of people [0.96909964]
2393 He was doing first-come-first served and not enforcing 15 minute limits [0.99127877]
2394 We were told we had to wait at least half an hour and there was nothing he could do [0.99418455]
2395 I asked around and it turns out he had other people booked into the same time slot and he made zero effort to get us in [0.9515982]
2396 This is during COVID so it's illegal to have multiple parties in the home at once [0.9887971]
2397 Basically violating real estate board rules by treating it like a standard open house and didn't care because he had a yard full of prospective buyers [0.9998991]
2398 We've been to 27 showings and never been treated so poorly [0.95898306]
2399 Ken Cui helped me to sell my house [0.9760916]
2401 Ken made the process fast and easy [0.96722674]
2402 He sold above asking price [0.9914462]
2403 I am very happy [0.7558635]
2405 (Team Calvin) We have called your office two times to take us off the list [0.9896693]
2406 And we are still getting mails about an expired agreement 2 years ago [0.6276435]
2407 Nu Stream Realty is possibly the laziest group of con artists I have ever met [0.96979296]
2408 If you are attempting to scam me do the respectful thing and at least try to make it interesting [0.98482084]
2409 Listing homes at 25% their realistic sale price and giving prospective buyers less then 12 seconds to view a home is not even coming close to the level it would take to defraud the average Vancouverite [0.45366216]
2410 I'm not sure what I expected from a group of people that look like they get their haircut and buy their shoes from the same air cadet supply store but I am genuinely hurt by their low-energy attempt squeeze me for money [0.8966252]
2411 These people need help [0.9727378]
2414 Deal with him is pleasant and feeling peace of mind [0.7703495]
2415 I do not recommend buyers viewing these agent’s listings [0.9691652]
2416 It can be a frustrating waste of time for a prospective buyer [0.9941607]
2417 Based on my review of two listed properties in Surrey it is my opinion Nu Stream uses a system for selling real estate that is not making the market efficient and seems unethical [0.9792093]
2418 They use a property’s list asking price as an invitation to make an offer which is legal but the list asking price has no close relation to the actual selling price [0.9983379]
2419 It reminds me of the travel agents practice of listing really cheap flights to entice you then adding on another 200% for taxes [0.98949957]
2421 These agents will also arrange open houses for short periods of time and limited hours where customers are rushed through the property in 3 minutes with others lined up out front to make the home look popular in order to create a false sense of interest in the property [0.96309865]
2422 These agents will present all offers to the seller as an indication of their market prowess but the seller will never counter-offer or will counter-offer with a price many tens of thousands higher than the listed asking price [0.97327924]
2423 This method wastes the buyer’s time and fosters distrust in the market [0.98879117]
2424 To me this is not making the market efficient it is creating a pricing uncertainty about the market and has the potential to foster and fuel further unethical practice among realtors who must compete [0.8451055]
2425 Further to my comments I was informed it is the Real Estate Council of BC ‘s policy that the seller has ultimate control of this market strategy and it is beyond the jurisdiction of real estate council scope to police its members in regards to this strategy [0.9785679]
2426 Good service [0.6866859]
2427 And I downloaded their App named Johome pretty good and useful [0.9779315]
2428 This level of unprofessional conduct should be examined by the real estate board or governing body [0.9836037]
2429 Have dealt with them on two occasions both horrible [0.95768505]
2430 Called management to complain and they do not respond professionally or adequately [0.68618405]
2432 Moreover they are a disgrace to hard-working Chinese people in this country - making a bad name for all Chinese here [0.99068594]
2433 Without a doubt the worst realty group I've had the misfortune to meet with [0.9779252]
2434 They post open houses with a asking price way below what the seller actually wants to entice you to make a bid and spark a bidding war with other buyers and will decline the asking price [0.9934518]
2435 They will then relist the place for 20% more than the original price they asked for in the first place [0.99838215]
2438 Terrible realty group that wastes everyone's time [0.8913541]
2439 They list homes far below the price their willing to sell for with the ambition to create lots of bidding wars [0.9983058]
2440 I'll never view one of their houses again [0.9856181]
2441 Super greasy real estate firm especially Maggie Zhu [0.4555454]
2443 They lie and are everything that are wrong with vancouver real estate  [0.9968644]
2444 Anything for a dollar  [0.828737]
2445 Don’t use these crooks  [0.9111489]
2446 These people need to be met with a contract lawyer [0.47617978]
2447 They use every trick in the book don't bother dealing with them [0.99810946]
2448 Rented a condo with the agent [0.853201]
2449 The lady was very friendly and helped me find a perfect suit while my budget was quite low [0.9764148]
2450 I have been living in my cozy home for few months and really love this place [0.97879523]
2451 Definitely will buy a house with them if possible [0.92941815]
2452 Everything you should not do as realtor this company/realtor does it all watch out for poor service interactions and communications [0.99838173]
2453 B/s & lied many times did not fulfill promises and company does not back up anything [0.7676854]
2454 Stay away stay away stay away from this company [0.88536876]
2456 Very difficult to work with when they stopped responding after you send over an offer [0.92531925]
2459 Don't buy a property listed from them [0.8234412]
2460 They are tricky and not genuine [0.998389]
2461 They list a property at a low price to attract you giving the offer and collect your information then they will dramatically raise the price by more than 20% based on the info they collect [0.44184664]
2463 I would sooner pass a kidney stone than deal with these people again [0.9701339]
2464 I walked into the Burnaby office a few days ago [0.96945274]
2466 She helped find an agent to answer my questions about rentals [0.9770449]
2467 Went to multiple open houses hosted by the Nu Stream Realty team and it was the same thing [0.9308411]
2468 The price is set low so we go and talk to the agent [0.9847109]
2469 They always say to us that the seller won't accept full ask and they are expecting or have received multiple offers [0.9494011]
2470 It's a huge waste of time I won't goto any open houses or viewings if Nu Stream is involved [0.9742611]
2471 This place needs to be renamed Nu Shady seriously [0.98879325]
2474 He helped me realize my dream [0.9787669]
2475 I would stay away any business dealing with this notorious realty company [0.9707016]
2476 Their agents are untrust worthy and unprofessional [0.5091805]
2477 They often list a low price which the seller will never accept when a full price is offered [0.9983901]
2478 A friend introduced nu stream to me and I went to there a couple of days ago the staff are very nice there they according to my requirements to give me some suggestion [0.97390336]
2479 I will go back again [0.969652]

2481 Zan impressed me the most [0.7937119]
2482 Nice service [0.68668735]

2487 Michelle Ao team helped me to find and purchase my apartment [0.9749718]
2489 EXCELLENT SERVICE WITH THEIR AGENT AMOO BAO [0.90893]
2491 Regarding the property on 7491 Imperial St [0.8014446]
2492  I just wanted to let you know that it is ridiculous to list a property for $1,000,000 for the open house weekend then change the price to $1,418,000 afterwards [0.96496975]
2493 This is a 40% increase which implies there was not intention to sell it at the previously listed price [0.9887934]
2495 It is a complete waste of time for the people who took the time to visit the open house [0.9942232]
2497 He is the listing realtor for the house I purchased and has been using stall tactics to avoid meeting the legal agreement [0.6567708]
2499 0 stars isn't available but it should be [0.93045014]
2500 Lawyers will now have to involved and the Real Estate board as well [0.80581903]
2502 I would not use Grace Li because she does not seem to value honesty [0.9695161]
2503 She listed a home on REW [0.9749223]
2504 ca did not advertise that it was tenanted for another year and ARGUED with us that we were wrong even though we showed her that her listing did not indicate it was tenanted [0.8848951]
2505 Even her feature sheet did not say it was tenanted but she kept arguing that we were wrong [0.98851776]
2506 Then she slammed the door on us [0.9982589]
2507 What an awful realtor [0.9825689]
2509 Despite all the previous reviews below [0.57780445]
2516 Your kids should be on the sidewalk [0.7930065]

2520 Very appreciate save me from any possible financial loss [0.8452208]
2523 Before the deadline even hit it was revealed that David didn't even tell his client about our offer and that he only presented the one prior offer which came in significantly lower than mine [0.58106947]
2524 Furthermore it wasn't but a week later that the very same apartment in question was found on Craigslist for rent using the exact same photos from the sale listing [0.99234086]
2525 Frankly I consider this poor and unethical business practice and outright shady [0.99803627]
2526 Never again will I or anyone that I know do business with David or any business he is associated with and I would caution you before doing so yourself [0.95546466]
2529 This woman brought an offer forward for my house without even qualifying her buyers [0.9883574]
2530 Her buyers were so dismissive of the processes that are standard procedures in CANADA that they wouldn't give the banks the information they needed to get a mortgage and this realtor would not return calls would not give information so these awful people wasted a good chunk of my precious selling time right up to the minute for the subjects to be removed with these horrible people and their bogus offer [0.94676626]
2531 TERRIBLE RUDE INCONSIDERATE and ARROGANT [0.94747585]
2533 Horrible company [0.8769753]
2536 They don't disclose anything on reports [0.9983393]
2537 Stay as far away from this company [0.8812749]
2538 Only get one star because you can check 0 [0.654939]
2540 He used racism when explaining the type of clients he does not take on [0.6080846]
2541 How does he still have his license [0.769254]
2542 He needs to be removed from the company [0.9914416]

2544 He is best realtor I have dealt with [0.9751861]
2545 I definitely recommend Ken Cui if anyone is looking to buy or sell a house [0.9693501]
2547 I was very happy with Ken's attitude service and efficiency [0.7116253]
2549 Before meeting Ken I was aware that there are many realtors in lower mainlands are manipulative but Ken is not like them [0.9676938]
2551 I would definitely ask Ken to list my properties in the future [0.9788307]
2552 I am quite impressive with Ken's service [0.9697941]
2553 Sien Chen from Nu Stream Realty is very deceptive [0.72401315]
2556 I don't know why Nu Stream hire people like this as if the goal of Nu Stream is to make every dollar from every customer [0.59891427]
2557 Nu Stream should perhaps watch out for their own employees before they start taking money from them [0.4469218]
2560 Ken Cui is the worst most deceptive and arrogant "realtor" (if you even call him a realtor) ever [0.530185]
2561 I have never in my life ever felt so cheated of my money [0.9788777]
2562 He might as well quit their jobs and become con artists [0.9909569]
2563 The issue is that the realtor fee was discussed already before but when it was time for payment they requested an additional $10,000 that was never discussed in the deal [0.9500403]
2565 HOWEVER everything was explained very detailed [0.74160546]
2566 Unfortunately Google does not allow me to give 0 stars because trust me they deserve a negative rating [0.9884881]
2567 To go more into detail Ken Cui is utterly and completely disgusting rude arrogant harsh and blunt [0.79159796]
2568 He has no idea how to treat his clients politely and has engaged in multiple arguments with me and all of them were started by him and his repulsive attitude [0.7789877]
2569 I hope this review helps and you are not fooled to use this realtor company [0.96237344]
2571 Realtor hosting an open house didn't seem to know much about the house they were showing and made some uncomfortable race-based remarks in Chinese [0.91223294]
2572 NU Stream agents Ken Cui and Martin Zhang helped us to find and purchase our current office [0.8835978]
2579 Very nice place I have been their new location at Burnaby; When I came in a lady with her kind smile brought me into a meeting room; After 5 mins Mr [0.93634623]
2581 One week later he came to my house and showed me more about my house; Even though I did not sell my house at that time I will ask him to list my house when I moved to other area [0.9782078]
2582 Nice office to work with [0.78641355]
2583 I am happy to be the first time buyer with Nustream decent service and kind ppl [0.88418406]
2584 I spoke to a realtor KEN CUI and he was the worst and stupid and arrogant realtor ever [0.5841185]
2585 I left detailed VMs to multiple properties as I am looking to buy a property [0.89585584]
2586 He called me back without listening to VM and started talking in whatever language I didn't understand [0.91912514]
2587 I mean it's not like he just missed my call and called me back seconds later [0.97732]
2588 He would've had more than enough time to listen to the VM before calling me from how long it took him to call me back [0.86112016]
2589 I wouldn't know which realtor is calling me back about which property as I'm looking at many listings so I purposely leave detailed messages [0.85169905]
2590 On top of that he started speaking in language I didn't understand [0.9392734]
2591 I asked him I don't understand what he's saying IN ENGLISH [0.9267077]
2592 He was so STUPID enough to continue talking in his language [0.9912937]
2593 Like how can someone be so incompetent [0.61408454]
2594 He eventually spoke English but the attitude was the worst [0.9907228]
2595 I will never use this company for this reason [0.96965796]
2598 This company is under investigation by the BC Real Estate Council and has been issued restrictions on its business practices because of serious breaches [0.9885628]
2601 Please do not call anymore I don't want to leave my company [0.49813494]
2602 Nu Stream keeps call me 3 days at night [0.8453469]
2603 I don't feel this is the way to recruit people [0.96961457]
2604 Bunch of scumbag con men [0.4925678]
2608 (Translated by Google) This real estate agency is really sketchy I would recommend to stay away from it [0.9888051]
2609 One of their realtors Maggie Zhu is totally un-professional and always asking for un-reasonable prices [0.93334615]
2611 Whether it is a buyer or a seller it is best not to cooperate with this company especially Maggie Zhu [0.86351806]
2613 If you are a seller she is just a waste of time if she has a good deal [0.9974477]
2614 (Original) This real estate agency is really sketchy I would recommend to stay away from it [0.9888004]

2667 Good service the company agent was help me answer all my questions and explain chargebacks fine [0.94676775]
2668 I lived in one of the rental buildings in downtown Vancouver BC for 4 years which was maintained by Korecki Real Estate Services Inc [0.9701185]
2671 The unit provided good value for money as it was completely furnished including all utilities [0.9843314]
2673 They are always prompt to address to my inquires [0.973335]
2674 I have had a really hard time getting ahold of anyone from the organization [0.91677356]
2675 I called the corporate number and the receptionist said she would have the appropriate account manager call me back [0.77176917]
2677 The response has been very slow if any [0.9853146]
2678 I will say the meeting was pleasant in-person; however communication in-between meetings is less than great - and that was if I got a call back [0.9036726]
2679 Since Korecki took over the management of the building that I own and live in the running of the building has been so much better [0.980931]
2681 This is so important for us as we have a large Strata [0.9887832]
2682 We stack in our garage we can not open the door to go out the garage [0.9941841]
2683 Its bad anagent company [0.9651953]
2684 We are all late for the appoinyments [0.9941847]
2685 Its poor management [0.9655994]
2686 So many people waiting to vome out of garage [0.99908257]
2687 What we should do call firefighters [0.98257697]

2698 How fortunate my building of 90 units and 7 commercial have been to acquire the skills of MIke to manage our building [0.9676866]
2699 His knowledge and "can do attitude" is unique in this field [0.93763727]

2706 If something needs doing at your building don't expect Korecki to do it [0.7288451]

2755 I’d connect with Carol again if I was to use a property management company in the future [0.9689398]
2759 Since Korecki took over the management of the building that I own and live in the running of the building has been so much better [0.980931]
2761 This is so important for us as we have close to 200 units in the building [0.9887712]
2762 Korecki manages the building I live in [0.9696523]
2764 I was a tenant at one of the properties managed by Korecki [0.9696298]

2847 Korecki was recommended to one of my stratas where I served on council and has been managing our 160+ units for the past two years [0.9784604]
2849 This is one of the worst management company I have ever encounter [0.9887632]
2850 The service is REALLY REALLY BAD [0.86741316]

2867 I had a series of bad managers damaging the value of my Vancouver properties [0.9786151]
2869 Korecki fit the bill and they impressed me with their work from the very beginning [0.95005965]
2870 One year in they are still operating splendidly [0.9491242]
2871 I had just constructed a beautiful building in Vancouver and all that was missing was tenants [0.969653]
2872 I felt rather nervous as I had heard horror stories of nightmare tenants breaking windows and trashing rooms [0.9696288]
2873 Thankfully the property managers at Korecki helped me out [0.9928363]

2876 I would highly recommend them to any stratas looking for new property management [0.9683102]
2877 This company is really unprofessional [0.9829911]
2878 They are extremely slow at depositing the collected rent from tenants into owners account [0.99797994]
2880 I absolutely would not recommend this company [0.969635]
2883 I've dealt with this company in the past and they were very lousy [0.9643452]
2884 Took forever to respond back to any issue [0.65385973]
2885 AWFUL [0.7496502]
2886 Zero emergency service [0.68749875]
2887 If something happens they will do nothing [0.99776256]
2888 They also stole $1200 set of tires by my car and didn't bother to let me know [0.9737731]
2889 The absolute laziest and worst mgt in Vancouver [0.9089806]
2892 Our timetable was very compressed and she had very short notice but it all went as well as we could possibly have hoped [0.960319]
2893 Many thanks for the great service Carol [0.7020354]
2896 The worst realtor in West Vancouver [0.89298064]
2897 He brings fake offers to get the listing and then never respect the contract [0.9887747]
2898 then just leave unexperienced realtors to show our house and only think about his commission and don't care if owner loses money and push to sell with low price to get his commission [0.9152862]
2899 I will never list or buy any property with him [0.96965164]

2921 I have also worked in Toronto and Vancouver so I can some how compare both Metropolitan areas in that sense It is not an easy job to keep up with the quality of your service once you have a lot of clients and this is the most interesting part of this Real Estate corporation no matter if you want to sell or buy or if your budget is medium or high which part of the city you are going to buy/sell or invest Team HamzeAli proved it to me they are capable of keeping up with everything that it takes to deliver the best result [0.93887407]

4194 Dimitri helped us move from a small condo to a town home to now a beautiful house in the last 5 years [0.88439435]
4195 He's also helped my mother-in-law found a great investment property in Olympic Village yielding really great rental income [0.97888917]
4196 You can ask him tonnes of questions everyday (some silly and some meaningful) he's always answering each and every one patiently [0.44326824]
4198 From start to finish Dimitri was on top of every small detail from photos listing to completion [0.790605]
4199 He would even stop you from making rash mistake of offering 'too much' or accepting an offer that's 'too low' [0.97927624]
4200 He will try his best to negotiate for the best price possible [0.98748165]
4202 We could not have asked for a better realtor to work with [0.9941837]
4203 At the end of the day our family finally after many moves found our perfect home and was able to make some money along the way : ) [0.8941739]
4205 My wife and I are from QC and wanted to invest in a unit for our pre-retirement [0.98101056]
4206 We hooked up with Dimitri with our list of needs [0.9941829]
4207 Visited units that corresponded and completed a sale rapidly [0.9228557]
4208 Dimitri,s servces extended beyond the traditional offer [0.98866534]
4209 We definitely recommend him and the Re/Max Westside team [0.9941845]
4212 He has a host of tradepeople at hand should you need assistance to do repairs or cleanup [0.9881464]
4213 We used him for the purchase of our new place as well and he was patient and understanding of what our needs were and looked for the appropriate showings for us to view [0.99384576]
4214 Dimitri understood that it may take a while to find our "place" and was willing to wait it out with us with no pressure to buy quickly [0.8859208]
4215 Dimitri is a realtor who has integrity and has a way that you do not feel as though you are being handled [0.9909412]
4216 Would we use him again Absolutely  [0.886804]
4217 G [0.91107345]
4219 Having purchased a 2-bedroom condo pre-construction at Block 100 in the Olympic Village I was one day checking on the progress of the building when Dimitri approached me and struck up a conversation [0.8700235]
4220 It turns out he was also living in the neighborhood and had also purchased a unit at Block 100 [0.994224]
4221 After a nice chat he requested my personal info and offered to keep me informed on market developments which I obliged despite not having a need for his services and already knowing dozens of realtors [0.44251788]
4222 Following our meeting Dimitri immediately followed up and proceeded to do exactly as he said and keep me informed on market trends and developments [0.8256984]
4224 When the time came for me to sell my 1-bedroom condo in the Olympic Village I decided to take a flyer on him despite knowing other great realtors [0.97471005]
4226 It amazes me how many people settle with such mediocrity and then get taken advantage of by harder working realtors with a deeper understanding of valuations superior negotiating skills etc [0.99116355]
4227 You can either pay a fee and get nothing in return (worse yet cost you money) or you can partner with someone like Dimitri and have them make you money and close deals [0.9251496]
4228 Dimitri ended up successfully selling my 865 square foot 1 bedroom for a new record high in the village at that time [0.9788909]
4229 Following that we purchased a 1-bedroom rental unit at Meccanica [0.92674667]
4230 Everything played out exactly as he had predicted [0.99854636]
4231 The unit I sold had less appreciable upside and prices plateaued following my sale over the coming year [0.9786531]
4232 The rental unit we purchased had at least a dozen offers and we only won due to our aggressive bid as was advised by Dimitri at the time [0.9251499]
4233 Finally he had boldly predicted that the purchased unit would topple $1K a square foot in the near future and a year later comparable units are selling well over that amount [0.94869876]
4235 I would wholeheartedly recommend Dimitri to anyone considering his services and will continue to use him as my realtor go forward [0.97861934]
4236 We spent years looking for our perfect home and Leilani patiently helped us through the whole time [0.99413365]
4237 We were so happy to finally find something this year and can't wait to move into it [0.9941823]
4239 As a real estate photographer I've worked with many agents over the years [0.99262816]
4240 There are some agents that just want a listing but don't do anything to help the sale [0.9961472]
4241 I've shot a couple of listings for Leilani recently and I am very impressed with her knowledge and how she treats her clients [0.7734893]
4242 She knows the market and she is always at the shoot does her own staging making sure the home is photo ready which as a photographer is very much appreciated [0.9526812]

4246 Leilani is everything I needed from a realtor and more [0.9699996]
4247 She helped me buy a condo in 2016 and did a great job of finding places to view that were in my budget and desired neighborhoods [0.9684136]
4248 Halfway through I realized what I really prioritized in a new place and Leilani adjusted the viewing schedule to match my new priorities well [0.9794102]
4249 Later when I needed to find a tenant for the condo she helped with that search as well [0.9696712]
4250 It was especially appreciated because I was unable to be in the same city around that time and couldn't host viewings for the whole time I was looking [0.993957]
4252 More recently I decided to sell the condo [0.9696538]
4253 Leilani walked me through the process including advising me on the proper steps for dealing with the tenant at the time [0.86581475]
4254 We communicated regularly but she never put undue pressure on me to lower my desired price or to accept unreasonable offers [0.992468]
4255 She even helped me find a handyman to take care of issues with my unit as part of the sale conditions [0.97057]
4256 Start to finish Leilani has been an excellent realtor who I can truly trust [0.96964484]

4265 Leilani was my realtor when I bought my condo in 2008 and then walked me through the process of selling it 12 years later [0.9765792]
4267 Her contacts for photography and cleaning made my apartment look stunning and her social media promotion brought over 80 people to the open house [0.95392543]
4268 She had perfect timing when she suggested I list my place- I got 14 offers and it sold in less than a week [0.97778845]
4270 She really is the best at what she does [0.97426933]
4271 Leilani has been our favorite realtor for more than 10 years [0.54322267]
4273 We highly recommend her whether you want to buy or sell a place [0.99417925]
4274 Working with Leilani was a great pleasure [0.85995024]
4275 Leilani sold our place after just a couple of weeks on the market with multiple offers [0.8889292]
4276 Being able to sell the place during this pandemic time is amazing [0.96518296]
4277 To top if off we sold the place for a price more than the selling price [0.72937953]
4279 If you or anyone is looking for a real estate agent that is caring very professional and would go above and beyond throughout the process I would say contact Leilani [0.90426666]
4282 This is my third time using Leilani to purchase a home and I would not hesitate to use her again [0.98858905]
4283 My husband and I started looking at homes when the market started to pick up [0.98101264]
4284 Unfortunately all the homes we liked all had accepted offers already [0.99968296]
4285 Leilani reassured us that she would do everything in her power to find us a place and was confident of that [0.8966653]
4286 Because of this we were confident in her [0.9997983]
4287 She made sure that we saw any new property right away and after a couple of weeks we found a place [0.96700996]
4288 After reading through the documents Leilani had some concerns and we decided to not move forward [0.7463549]
4290 She never pressured us to buy and always had our best interest at heart [0.9013223]
4291 We did eventually find a place which we got a great price on [0.9941846]
4292 She fought for us till the end [0.9140733]
4296 I would highly suggest her to anyone that wants a realtor that is not just your salesperson but also your friend advisor and trusted confidant [0.7073092]
4300 Having a 7month old baby it seemed impossible for us to painlessly sell our condo and buy a detached house in the Lower Mainland [0.905835]
4301 Well we did it within a month – all thanks to Leilani [0.99135894]
4302 We interviewed several realtors before we decided to hire Leilani and here is why we chose her: She impressed us with her ability to actively listen and respect our priorities her strong marketing and negotiation skills and last but not least her engaging personality and passion for real estate [0.98597807]
4303 Long story short she did not disappoint us [0.8844369]
4304 She voluntarily organized and staged our cluttered condo managing to sell our place within a couple of weeks with multiple offers in a buyer’s market [0.966474]

4316 We are very happy to have met Leilani we were selling our condo in PoCo last September with another realtor and we had it on the market for three months and nothing was happening we were desperate and our prior realtor was only giving us false hopes without any effort from her side when we met Leilani we saw right away that there are levels to this [0.99413145]
4317 She immediately show us what we were doing wrong and what we could improved she staged fully our place [0.90205777]

4322 I live in the Netherlands I was difficult to get hold of I was preoccupied and really not engaged as I should have been [0.9696505]
4323 I would have fired me [0.8857708]
4324 Instead Leilani took care of everything from painting repairs furniture removal to new keys and literally got me 15% more than I thought I could legitimately expect [0.9320529]
4325 In a downward turning market she was able to create a buzz and a bidding war [0.9810192]

5131 His words were "You'll know when you're ready [0.9457995]
5132 " So when I was ready even though I interviewed other realtors who also had a lot of experience or who were younger flashier and had a better online "image" I decided to go with the very experienced and personable (easy to talk with) Andrew and Jill team [0.99746835]
5133 I am so glad I did as there were setbacks such as the change in the market an offer that fell through and an unexpected extensive and expensive removal of an oil tank which no other realtor could have guided me through as well as Andrew did [0.8931397]

5162 Let me start off by saying that Andrew & Jill are fantastic [0.86384153]
5163 We first met them when my family was trying to sell my grandparents house about ten years ago [0.9895744]
5164 It had already been on the market with a different realtor for almost a year with no luck [0.99419934]
5165 When they took over they made the appropriate suggestions and it worked [0.99033135]
5166 Within a short few months (maybe about 4 months max [0.98984295]
5168 Fast forward about 5 years due to unforeseen health circumstances it became time for our family to downsize [0.89286625]
5169 It all happened so fast and Andrew and Jill were kind compassionate intuitive professional and oh so helpful with the sale of my mum's house [0.6317412]
5170 They dedicated themselves 100% to making sure the house was sold [0.976333]
5171 They were not only focused on the sale of the house but also mindful of the circumstances we were selling them under [0.9906847]
5172 After the sale of the house they helped us in finding our perfect little family home now [0.8851147]
5173 They took us to many different open houses back to back to back until we had no more places to see and had found the place for us [0.9302143]
5174 My mum wasn't certain about the place at first [0.98101306]
5175 But with Jill's keen eye for home interiors and reconstruction and Andrew's sharp senses and suggestions we've now lived comfortably in our home for over five years and couldn't be happier [0.9935215]
5176 They referred contractors and more to help us with renovations and the place really feels like home now [0.9857282]
5179 We were referred to Andrew and Jill Hasman by friends who had purchased a property through them a few years ago [0.9941845]
5180 When we were considering selling our house last year we called them [0.9939893]

5982 He helped me narrow down my search and to decide on which building would yield me the best return on investment as well as providing much-needed strata information [0.9634519]
5983 It was so helpful [0.98937875]
5984 But that’s not the thing that impressed me the most it was the way he helped me when I faced a family emergency just days before the deal closed [0.8675698]
5985 The deal was at the tedious stage where all of the details about lawyers and paperwork are at their thickest [0.5753296]
5986 And thankfully Daylan was there to guide me through the process [0.8862005]
5987 He showed empathy and compassion and went out of his way to help with all aspects [0.98987377]
5989 So fast forward to February 2020 and it was no-brainer that I’d use Daylan again to sell my condo [0.9982777]
5990 He was prepared and knew the market I trusted his opinions and felt comfortable with his selling strategy [0.9460336]
5991 And just like how he predicted I had two offers on the first open house [0.97929525]
5992 We had a conditional offer everything in place potential buyers were pre-approved the deal looked like an easy one [0.99418294]
5993 However no one saw the shakeup that was about to happen thanks to Covid-19 [0.9824241]
5994 Once the world shut down things in the deal became complicated as the banks were in an upheaval [0.9919388]

7115 Leo recently helped my wife and I purchase our first single family home just off of Main St [0.97868955]
7116 We had been watching the single family market for the previous 12 months and continually watched homes sell for well over asking [0.9941846]
7117 Leo came to us with us a house in our ideal neighborhood that was near the top of our price point [0.88525486]
7118 He had seen a recent price reduction and thought this could be the perfect home for us [0.9569983]
7119 Leo suggested that this home coule work well because it had been on the market for over 30 days and the sellers may be flexible on price due to the recent price drop [0.86510485]
7120 After much back and forth we purchased the home at almost $200,000 under the original asking price [0.96973807]

7147 In a market like Vancouver Leo's constant communication helped me feel at ease when things were moving quickly [0.8008944]

7186 I have purchased and sold 6 properties in the last 15 years and can confidently say that Leo is the best of the best in realtors [0.96964884]
7187 We are pretty picky people and Leo was patient and worked with us to understand exactly what we were looking for [0.9941708]
7188 He went the extra extra mile and actually found our home before it was listed in the market because he knew it would be a great place for us [0.9481733]
7189 He knows how to work with buyers ensuring we are comfortable every step of the way and best of all can land a home in this crazy market [0.97984844]
7190 I could not recommend Leo any higher [0.96948326]

7192 If you are seriously shopping for a home look no further than Leo [0.9976807]

7195 In the end we sold for a price we were very happy with and look forward to purchasing a new home with him [0.43339664]
7199 Where to begin [0.95196056]
7200 Leo is simply the best in the business [0.78027654]

7207 You can't go wrong [0.9314503]
7210 Leo Wilk was recommended to me by a close friend even with such a glowing recommendation we were still surprised by how great he was [0.7208537]
7212 After our first meeting he sent us home with a great first time buyers guide that he and Niki Cuthbert a Mortgage Broker (who is also fantastic and they just make the best team [0.8591132]
7214 We really felt taken care of [0.9941847]
7215 Leo was always available in fact I remember talking to him a few times on Thanksgiving [0.969897]
7216 He encouraged us to not be impulsive with our decision (I definitely needed that) which was very admirable since I've had a few people tell me they felt rushed by their Realtor [0.8709338]
7217 I really can't say enough good things anyone who needs a Realtor will just have to meet him and find out for themselves [0.9694151]
7218 As a newcomer to Vancouver and a first-time homebuyer I had a lot of questions - everything from neighbourhood vibe to relative value to the mortgage and homebuying process - Leo assured me there were no stupid questions [0.6416364]
7219 Throughout the process he was extremely responsive and accessible [0.60917246]
7220 After viewing numerous properties together I knew when I had found "the one," but was apprehensive to move forward when it had all happened in just over a week [0.9696327]
7222 Leo also referred me to an excellent mortgage broker Niki Cuthbert who made the process as smooth and painless as possible while helping me secure an excellent rate [0.4590666]

7225 Always available and looking out for us every step of the way [0.8845282]
7228 Leo is one of the few realtors in this city/market who won't sweep something under the rug (pun intended) in order to close a deal [0.78064466]
7230 Moreover I have enjoyed working with him on purchasing condos and a detached house [0.9785005]
7231 He made the process quite enjoyable and when we made him go the extra mile (and felt bad doing so) he worked hard and late and did it so eagerly it seemed like he enjoyed it [0.9818107]
7232 It was really great to work with a bona-fide expert but feel so comfortable and friendly the entire time [0.9941792]
7233 Having Leo as our real estate agent was the best decision my husband and I ever made [0.97874284]

7238 He's experienced & trustworthy you can't go wrong working with him [0.43008128]
7239 Wow [0.97325605]
7240 I have a million great things I could say about Leo [0.9695041]
7241 I recently purchased my first condo through Leo and I have no idea what I would have done without his help [0.9786983]
7242 He truly cares for his clients and has their best interest in mind [0.46491352]
7243 He is not like many realtors who are eager to sell take their commission and move on to the next client [0.8279665]
7244 During our first meeting he gave me his 'Home Buyers 101' where he explained to me in detail how the process works what to expect and what 'red flags' to look out for [0.85857606]
7245 Leo helped me read through many different strata documents and advised me not to buy twice during the process where he felt it was a risky investment [0.8470303]
7247 Leo will not let you make a mistake and is passionate about placing buyers in homes that will bring them happiness (not stress) [0.5271894]
7248 From the beginning he was transparent about how he works and what to look out for on the market [0.9364497]
7249 He was patient and guided me through the process of finding a place to call home - I shopped for a condo for about 9 months and never felt rushed [0.90156776]
7250 Now it seems like a fun part of my week is missing when I don't get to hop into the car with Leo and check out some condos [0.9788689]
7251 Leo is a realtor who works with his heart a rarity in todays marketplace [0.4428751]
7253 Niki Cuthbert (askniki [0.6374741]
7255 They are both good people who made me feel safe and confident enough to take such huge step in my life [0.97636545]
7256 I couldn't have done it without them and cannot say enough about how great they both are [0.96927303]
7259 Bought and sold a condo and a house with him [0.5608421]
7260 Seamless no headaches he was worked around the clock to make the deal go through [0.9392061]
7261 One of Vancouver top agents [0.9373528]
7262 Nothing but a pleasure to work with [0.92403233]
7263 10/10 service [0.6866764]
7265 Excellent [0.48863953]
7267 Our property has been well-managed by Prompton for several years now [0.96016705]
7268 We have always experienced efficient and professional service [0.86940354]
7269 Our new property manager Jess Baddan recently had super-ceded our expectations by securing good tenants in a quick turnaround and with a higher than expected rental income as well [0.9604678]
7271 What I appreciate most about Jess is how relational and personal she is; genuinely caring for her clients [0.9820511]
7272 We are feeling very blessed with Jess through Prompton [0.9941846]
7273 Definitely 5 stars [0.94972867]
7274 It all started when I was still in Toronto and decided to relocate to Vancouver for a new job opportunity [0.99376804]
7275 I started looking for an apartment that is facing north to enjoy the great views of the mountains and relatively in a new building at the same time very close to the sky tram for an easy commuting to work [0.9695007]
7276 I was lucky enough to see an add about an apartment on Prompton Real Estate Services Inc [0.9698005]
7280 She explained everything required to close the deal [0.9651591]
7283 I would absolutely recommend Prompton Real Estate Services Inc [0.96897227]
7285 Horrible services [0.6107198]
7286 We have been engaging with them for over 2 weeks trying to rent an apartment for my retired parents that they have listed on their website [0.99342996]
7287 1) Agent does not respond to our messages or when she does it takes 3-4 days [0.6691984]
7288 2) Agent has cancelled THREE appointments with us minutes AFTER the scheduled time 3) Agent has called my professional references even though we have not yet been "approved" by the landlord 4) We have been providing them with several documents and every day there is something else we need to provide (ps* I am high earning executive I own 2 properties in Vancouver and am certainly very qualified to rent a place for my folks) [0.990621]
7289 Working with Prompton Vancouver has been an absolute disaster and I will encourage anyone not to engage with them - very unprofessional [0.6990908]
7290 We recently moved into a great apartment in Yaletown managed by Corry with Prompton [0.99418455]
7291 The process was quick and smooth and we were even given access a day ahead of of our official move-in date [0.9820251]
7292 Couldn't be more satisfied [0.4038338]
7294 My leasing manager Monica G [0.98102593]
7296 I definitely recommend Prompton and Monica if you're looking for a new home - though I'm sure the rest of the team is just as great [0.96238405]
7297 I have been a tenant in a Spectrum condo  run by Prompton Real Estate Services Inc [0.9699911]
7298 The quailty of the service that I have received from Sharmini who works at Prompton has been really great [0.9704185]
7299 Superior actually [0.7896298]
7300 She responds to my questions immediately and any issues have been taken care right away [0.9611689]
7301 I have to say that I have been so pleased by the quality of care and attention to my questions and concerns [0.9625838]
7302 Moving forward if I choose to move I will search out a condo that is run by Prompton Real Estate Services Inc [0.96974665]
7303 5-star to my experience with my property manager Jess Baddan who went above and beyond to help my husband and I from our very first contact up to now [0.944461]
7305 When we arrived to the building we were still in mandatory quarantine due to international travel and she gently organised to take our garbage out while we would not be able to leave the apartment [0.9937517]
7306 We were definitely not expecting this such great help [0.9941847]
7307 We are more than happy with our experience [0.993477]
7309 I would avoid them if you’re a prospective tenant [0.96874523]
7310 The units they post are listed with inaccurate photos of “similar” units and some are completely trashed by previous tenants [0.98675555]
7311 I can’t fathom why a property manager would even show a unit that hasn’t been fixed properly to a prospective tenant [0.8681433]
7312 To top it off they use shady used car salesman tactics to get you to offer more money by telling you they have other competing “applications” pending [0.88867927]
7313 It was an awesome experience working alongside with Jeremy in the transition of a condo sale [0.9778673]

7323 My husband and I moved from Ontario and we had an excellent experience working with Prompton specifically with Megan Neumann and Jess Baddan [0.97969645]
7325 The process of initiating occupancy of a rental property in Surrey BC was seamless and very straight forward due to Prompton [0.96487784]

7347 Myself & My wife are new to BC Jess helped us find just the right apartment with in our budget [0.9810124]
7348 she has been very responsive towards all our requests as well helped us fix any minor issues we had during our move in this new apartment [0.8428759]
7349 I would recommend her to my friends if anyone is looking to find a new place to live [0.9787568]
7351 I highly recommend renting property through Prompton [0.9693281]
7354 Not only were they clear and informative about the suite I was moving into but they genuinely cared that it was right for me [0.86167866]
7355 I would definitely recommend them to a family member and thus I would to you as well [0.9648219]
7356 We've had the privilege of having Corry Buchanan as our property manager for the last year and we cannot express enough how wonderful it's been to work with her [0.6003211]
7358 Whenever we've had issues with the unit she's been quick to provide support and solutions [0.9926303]
7359 She's so easy to work with and she makes getting things fixed a painless process [0.6993858]
7360 We look forward to working with her for many years to come [0.99418724]
7361 My wife and I rented a condo unit in Surrey from Prompton where we stayed almost 3 years [0.9810119]
7362 We were very pleased with the experience [0.96072125]
7365 When we adopted our second dog Prompton was very supportive in getting this allowed by the suite owner [0.9850693]
7367 I have had a few encounters now with Property Managers from Prompton all of which have been positive except for the most recent one [0.9700091]
7368 As a prospective tenant searching for a rental I came across a unit on Craigslist that I was very interested in [0.98846024]
7371 We went back and forth a couple times trying to arrange a time that worked for both of us [0.993994]
7372 Once she proposed a time that worked for both of us I agreed and confirmed with her [0.97594744]
7373 I took time off work and arrived on the day of the viewing [0.9717345]
7374 She was nowhere to be found [0.9749623]
7376 I waited an hour for her with no response so I left without seeing the unit [0.9695841]
7377 Hours later that same evening she emailed me back and apologized for not having confirmed the time with the current tenant and forgetting to tell me that [0.8462176]
7379 Very frustrated I emailed back asking for a later time [0.9693766]
7380 She never responded [0.9749623]
7381 And regardless the posting got removed very shortly after [0.9906406]
7382 I am so disappointed with not only the original miscommunication but the lack of response and carelessness that was exhibited afterwards [0.5195022]
7383 It was an incredible display of unprofessionalism and I hope that other Property Managers are held accountable to a much higher level than this one [0.99409646]
7384 This company has been managing my building since I moved in 2017 [0.98764324]
7385 They are always prompt and timely in the replies to my requests [0.9234064]
7386 Always have things fixed as soon as I request them to be fixed [0.96858615]
7387 The superstars on the team are Meagan and Jenna they are both indispensable to the company [0.9564442]
7388 I would recommend this property management company to anyone [0.9695102]
7389 Also straight up heads up to my main man Jason at Strata Pro [0.9788908]
7390 Always doing the fix ups 🤟 [0.8803986]
7392 The rental is very clean and holds extremely good value over other rentals we were considering (pets/insuite laundry/transit) [0.98167413]
7393 Our property manager Jenna has also been exceptional [0.9605148]
7396 I was very happy to have Monica G as my property manager [0.97883207]
7398 If I had any questions or concerns she would address them right away and follow up to make sure matters were resolved [0.9277699]
7399 During a difficult time for me when I had to move Monica was very kind and guided me through the process which I very much needed since I was overwhelmed and stressed [0.8897651]
7401 The service is quite sub par for a company that rents out concord buildings [0.91641957]
7402 You can tell the employees don’t enjoy the work [0.94024664]
7403 Particularly said no pets but apartment is trashed and damaged by pets [0.8423162]
7404 Before moving out they will charge their tenants any fees possible [0.9673587]
7405 Ended up pissing off tenants as well [0.9214579]
7406 Yet the charges go to them not to owner [0.9748328]
7407 Therefore both tenants and owner be aware [0.9862392]
7408 I have shifted my apartment during Pandemic time [0.9788442]

7419 Our move out was without any hassle in the middle of the pandemic & special thanks goes to Jenna [0.96016705]
7421 It was very easy to communicate with Monica [0.8633098]

7441 They would blast upon if you dare to call them [0.9360144]
7442 They dictate terms terms and treat tenants as if they are begging / taking favours from them [0.99821657]
7443 In case you decide to take a property in Concord Paciifc get in touch with landlords directly [0.5801584]
7444 I am sure they would treat you better [0.96669716]
7445 I've had the pleasure to work with Monica Emily and Ting-Yi at Prompton [0.9021797]
7449 I love how they respond quickly to my emails when I need something [0.9782284]

7485 Through the years in using Prompton services their client communication and service delivery has progressively improved [0.5605342]

7497 And after moving in she and Emily Leasing Administrator are taking very good care of us [0.9725064]

7526 I finish the contract on December 31 2020 [0.9788635]
7527 I leave perfect the studio that I rented for almost 2 years [0.969652]
7528 The property manager which Her name is Sharmini for all the 2 years She was very rude with me and She never ever attended me on time [0.9010912]
7529 She thinks She is the owner of the hole word and always wants to give orders [0.97576976]
7530 Because of that I was afraid that when She was going to review the apartment on the delivery day She was going to look for any pretext in order to get money from my rent deposit [0.9932851]
7531 And I was right She did not find anything wrong on the apartment because it was perfect [0.98173726]
7532 But now She got a new pretext because the smell [0.9952447]
7533 Because of that I do not recommend Prompton specially with Sharmini [0.9997847]
7534 And finally I am still waiting for my deposit [0.9788924]
7535 Sharmini told me that She hasn't give it because we are still on "holidays" and today is January 8th [0.8533667]
7536 Finally I rented the studio in $2,000 [0.9717652]
7537 00cad and in order not to go away they told me that the new price was going to be $1,600 [0.84541786]
7539 You can imagine I feel assaulted [0.9394618]
7540 For 2 years they could give me the monthly rent on $1,600 [0.84534615]
7541 00 instead $2,000 [0.9725221]
7544 I have been using Prompton service for my properties for years [0.978762]

7564 Was in a suite managed by Prompton in Surrey for 4 years [0.80547976]
7566 I swear my particular property manager was basically some kind of wizard - every issue was resolved promptly (#seewhatIdidthere [0.9790114]
7567 ) and on several occasions acted as the perfect barrier between myself and a particularly pesky landlord [0.7354335]
7568 10/10 would use again [0.91508096]
7569 I've had a wonderful experience with my Prompton leasing manager and her team [0.6564514]
7571 I've used Megan's help on two separate occasions for my rental needs and she has gone above and beyond to help me secure my suites [0.97754616]
7572 She and Jess have treated me like family and I do recommend their services [0.88356]
7573 I had used Prompton in 2019 when I secured my rental in Surrey [0.9783495]
7574 And used them again for my new suite in 2020 [0.97963715]
7575 This year I needed a place with short notice and Megan found a place for me in less than two weeks and helped me in planning my move during the pandemic lock-down [0.9856611]
7576 As I've mentioned above I've nothing but good things to say about Megan Jess and Prompton [0.9891054]
7578 throughout my 5 year tenancy I had zero worries about any maintenance that needed to be done [0.978496]
7580 For anyone new in the Lower Mainland I suggest you get Prompton Real Estates [0.96504945]

7583 Definitely recommend them for anyone who is new to BC [0.94991034]
7587 Nice and brand new apartment [0.85018736]
7588 The appliances are new and of great quality [0.978658]
7589 My property manager Monica G [0.98102236]
7592 Monica Gayser is the Property Managet who assisted us in processing our application with Prompton [0.8813999]
7594 She’s very organized prompt in replying to our emails and very clear in explaining the details of the process [0.47910246]
7595 We can call and ask our questions to some things we’re not sure of [0.9610266]
7598 We had amazing experience renting from Cory at Prompton [0.99402195]
7599 The property manager was really nice to me showed up on time and did her best to prepare the apartment for us [0.8508148]
7600 When we had problems with the building the property manager always tried her best to help us to deal with building manager [0.8638376]
7602 Prompton has a wonderful team they are so friendly [0.9043482]
7603 We received a high quality and professional service from Monica Geyser ( the senior property manager) and her team [0.97186637]
7604 spoken to Jess onetime she was so rude not willing to help [0.7912211]
7605 I have applied couple of time and due to covid I had to change my plans [0.9780777]
7606 I explained her my situation and I can't understand why was yelling at me just for inquiries I have asked overtime [0.9693655]
7608 I'm so thankful I was able to get an apartment with prompton real estate [0.9651817]
7612 My property manager prefers emails and every time I call the office I'm transferred to VM [0.9810134]
7613 The Service is not very good [0.9849045]
7616 I knew then I would use their services when I buy an apartment of my own [0.97870845]
7617 Now Jenna is taking care of my apartment and I have never been in any stress as she is always on top of everything [0.97883284]
7618 I trust her to make the right decision on my behalf [0.97880155]
7619 All the staff I have dealt with till now since the start have been very polite and understanding towards my needs as a client [0.94156307]
7620 All I would like to say is a big "Thank you" and keep it up [0.9696663]
7622 It has been a pleasure to work with Jenna Property Manager of Prompton [0.99305826]
7623 Everything has been taken cared [0.9985464]
7625 I lived in one of the properties they managed for over a year [0.96965325]
7627 Lynne was my property manager and she always went above and beyond to help me out [0.9766513]
7628 Monica Geyser is a friendly and efficient property manager who took the time to answer all my questions before and after the move in [0.96740586]
7629 I can always count on her to get back to me quickly and she's constantly trying her best to help [0.8807809]
7630 On multiple occasions while trying to get in contact with multiple different agents it has taken me up to 5 attempts to actually get a hold of the agent I was trying to get a hold of at the time [0.79752886]
7631 If this happened with 1 agent it wouldn't be anything to really note but FOUR different agents all the same - anywhere from 3 to 5 attempts to connect over multiple weeks- through direct emails through messaging sent through apps they advertise on and by phone [0.8375416]
7632 Why [0.66459864]
7633 Not to mention that the properties listed as "pet friendly" ALL have a weight limitation on the pets [0.80690616]
7635 (I know most landlords in BC do [0.98690194]
7636 Which is highly bias) But there is NO room for consideration with Prompton even if the pet is quiet socialized exceptionally well behaved senior (low energy) trained and the owners are responsible [0.9726189]
7638 Moving from Ontario during a pandemic seemed like a challenge for finding a place to live but when I inquired about a unit with Prompton I received a quick response and I was approved for the unit within a few hours [0.9694862]
7639 The property manager Jenna has been very good to work with and was able to help get Internet/Cable connected before I arrived so I would not have to wait 2 weeks [0.9735566]
7641 This is my third rental through Prompton and I highly recommend them [0.98512614]
7642 Everyone is very professional and helpful - my last move had to be done very quickly and Jenna went above and beyond [0.7145062]
7643 For several years Prompton has been managing the administration of my apartments and thanks to their excellent work I can focus on other matters with the confidence that PROMPTON is always attentive that my properties are in perfect condition and that my tenants are happy to live there  [0.97849315]
7645 This management had made everything easy for us during the pandamic [0.98878056]
7647 Special thanks to Monica Geyser the senior property Manager [0.53931594]
7648 In thier properties you can find people from all backgrounds which means they treat everyone equally And these units they advertise for look way better in reality [0.982864]
7650 I know Prompton represents the owner not the tenant but you would think they would want a happy tenant [0.9628227]
7651 For me I have got 0 support for my issues with Rancho and there threatened violations of Illegal entry and targeted video surveillance at W1 [0.9695136]
7652 Really pleased with Monica as a property manager [0.7845771]
7654 Most importantly I don't feel like I'm getting scolded if I have to reach out to her for anything [0.9696295]
7655 I move a lot and have dealt with various real estate services [0.97058576]
7656 Prompton Real Estate Services was by far the worst when it comes to customer service [0.6678541]
7657 My partner and I drove all the way to Richmond 3233 Ketcheson Road and waited 15 minutes for Sharlene only to receive an email that she can't make it to the appointment [0.97977865]
7660 Rest assured I will leave this bad review everywhere I could and hope others won't have their time wasted like you wasted ours [0.96024525]
7661 Jenna and the team at Prompton had such a big task getting our place ready for move-in as the last tenants left the apartment in a state of disrepair [0.89795405]
7663 There were a few things that were broken when we moved in but all issues were fixed right away often the same day [0.9917582]
7666 With fast response and superior professionism I think Promoton is the best choice [0.96977365]
7670 I would not recommend using them if they were the last property manament company in town [0.96889794]
7672 Very disheartening when you are putting them in charge of millions of dollars in assets [0.52447397]
7674 Very professional they have been my property manager for 4 years and have never faltered [0.97241217]
7675 Monica Geyser managed the sub-penthouse we rented in Yaletown [0.9210242]
7679 There was a lease rental available on Powell Street [0.9962362]
7680 A two story top floor unit with a large rooftop deck [0.919745]
7681 I liked it [0.9696522]
7682 I supplied my references a published business interview and 12 months of bank statements [0.9777756]
7683 I was told to have my [0.97887623]
7684 Tenancy insurance and proof that this was current and paid for before they would do my initial walk through [0.97889113]
7685 On that same day the building manager at the address I would be moving into was pointed out to me and I was told by to be sure to get on the right side of him [0.89942074]
7686 I had been looking for some time and with this decision made I turned down the other potential homes [0.96960485]
7687 Packed and ready the movers spent the previous day packing the moving truck [0.9720799]
7688 9 a [0.90269893]
7690 we arrive at the new place I am greeted with a gruff " you better get a move on [0.9613062]
7691 " I was then told I only had the elevator for two hours until 11 [0.96965164]
7692 ( An impossible task to unload a 2 bedroom home off the truck in the elevator and unloaded into a suite on the 8th floor ) So I asked when was the next time I could block some time [0.9990517]
7693 Two weeks from that day and it would still be for only two hours [0.9311878]
7694 So I asked if I could then unload into the lobby and we would then have to good it up the stairs [0.99908084]
7695 No the stairwell use was prohibited  [0.9420337]
7696 So I told the movers to put back in the truck what they had started to move [0.9990769]
7697 This man was not helpful in any way [0.9840662]
7698 His manner was confrontation and uncompromsing [0.94578516]
7699 I clearly had no choice but to walk away [0.96964544]
7701 I was told by the Prompton real estate representative that the move in was my problem to deal with not theirs [0.97878057]
7702 This has cost me overtime with the movers and truck costs associated with now moving to a storage facility and causing me to be now in a homeless situation [0.986943]
7703 I had planned a short move in town and not a move where access and organisation for stored clothes medications etc were needed [0.96954805]
7705 This made it all the more it upsetting [0.9887934]
7706 I received no apology I did however receive a veiled threat to take me to the rental board for breaking the lease [0.8993279]
7707 No offer to compensate my losses and continued expenses [0.97888786]
7710 Oh and I had to e-transfer $100 to the building manager to have him be at the front door to let me in [0.98658293]
7711 I would warn against using this property management company [0.9668388]
7712 Their dismissive and uncaring attitude has caused me great upset and loss of [0.9887607]
7713 money and home [0.71490145]
7715 Amazing service [0.6866848]
7718 Terrible service [0.68668586]
7720 They have been my family's property manager and they have always been very slow and unprofessional [0.9783083]
7721 Last week they contacted me saying my insurance policy have changed suddenly and is effective immediately [0.9743049]
7722 First of all Prompton should have inform us right away since Prompton got the notification from the insurance days earlier [0.8066837]
7723 Suddenly Im scrambling to find new insurance and I asked them to verify some information for my new insurance and they never even answered back even though they know this is an urgent matter [0.9673157]
7724 I sent emails multiple times but they never answered me back [0.70568544]
7725 Also I am trying to cancel their service but they made it really hard to cancel it [0.9702134]
7726 If you don't cancel it by 30 days of your renewal date they will charge 3 MONTHES of management fee [0.5035872]
7727 They don't notify you when you are due for renewal so I have to ask them and hopefully they will email me back this time [0.7303677]
7730 Really easy to work with and always responds in a timely matter [0.90322804]
7731 This is a company I really want to recommend [0.98877764]
7732 I moved here from Calgary 4 years ago and as soon as I came to Vancouver I rented an apartment from Prompton and lived there for a year and a half [0.9696659]
7734 When I asked for something they always acted quickly and completely [0.99383825]
7735 Anyway what I want to say is that this is a reliable company [0.9775379]
7736 I've worked at Prompton for over 2 years and I absolutely love this team [0.9817039]
7737 We had amazing experience renting from Inga Darii via Prompton [0.9923805]
7738 She was amazingly nice to us always showed up on time and did her best to prepare the apartment for us [0.90728575]
7739 Prompton is now our #1 choice for landlord when it comes to renting [0.88950664]
7741 No matter you are tenant or unit owners please avoid it [0.4152009]
7742 There GM is pretty bad in customer service no one take care about you once you signed contract they only care about is how to earn more money from you [0.98131]
7745 They have really good properties [0.99838805]
7749 Don't go near this place [0.9425328]
7753 Megan is the GOLD STANDARD when it comes to Customer Service [0.51750124]
7755 I was ready to book my flights to take a look at a couple of suites when Aime Bent just stopped replying to my messages after hers "are you just flying in for the viewing [0.97860086]
7757 I was recently a resident of Ontario and to a surprise was presented with an opportunity to move to BC [0.9650189]
7758 For days I was stressed about finding a new home and one that was in my budget to boot [0.9787061]
7759 I spent hours on the phone trying to source a reliable leasing agent with no luck what so ever [0.9694368]
7760 I then came across a building online and completely fell in love with it [0.9696485]
7761 I contacted Megan at the Prompton office immediately as I was very excited to have found my new potential home [0.97550225]
7762 Megan took the time to listen to my current situation wants and needs [0.9788746]
7763 We made an appointment to look at the property of my choice along with some other openings she had available [0.99264807]
7764 In the end the building I desired most had no available units for rent Megan could see the sadness this brought [0.9696414]
7765 I was about to settle on one of the other buildings that I was keeping on the back burner but to my surprise Megan called me the next day with great excitement that there was a unit available in the building I really wanted to live in [0.97235674]
7766 My interactions with Megan were very professional follow up was immediate she shared her passion picked up on my thoughts and delivered 110% I have to give this company a 5 star rating [0.98097205]
7767 Anyone moving into any area where Prompton services they come highly recommended from me [0.8448088]
7768 Very poor management Totally not recommended this management company My unit has no heater and no hot water in snowing winter time Their manager MG she was telling me to go to Costco to buy heater and once it’s fixed go back and returned it” What kind of manager said that kind of stuff [0.98139334]
7769 Every year  they raise the rent But very poor response  every time we have problems One of my electronics plug is not working since I moved  more that years They never fixed [0.98022014]
7770 Not recommend at all All stuff here are very rude [0.9785569]
7771 I recently moved in the Alexandra [0.9696522]
7772 Jennene is my new property manager [0.9791757]
7773 I found her to be friendly considerate and very able [0.9690947]
7774 She answered all my questions provided me with every document swiftly and even a kind reminder when I failed to fill send everything back as instructed [0.9606518]
7775 My unit was clean and ready for my move in and she was very thorough with me during the inspection to ensure I was covered fully [0.9810028]
7776 I highly recommend her and Prompton [0.96940476]
7777 I wish I had their services for my own properties out East [0.97881395]
7779 Who makes up these stupid policies [0.8078189]
7780 Do i need to draw out a sleeping plan to hand in [0.9475929]
7781 Trying to rent a place is made into such a big deal [0.87675047]
7784 Someone physically wanting to watch us sleep [0.88620627]
7785 Worst service [0.6866848]
7786 I have condo that I was personally managing and things got out of hand as it was too much to handle on top of my full time job  [0.97921413]
7787 Candice from Prompton has helped me with the process from a - z  and I didn't have to stress and worry [0.91162133]
7788 She got me a high rent that covered my entire mortgage + strata fees [0.9735806]
7791 Im assuming they were well aware the apartment was already rented well before our viewing time [0.8946799]
7792 Complete waste of time and completely disorganized [0.87687534]
7793 I'll count this as a blessing in disguise because if this was my first impression I can only imagine the nightmare of having a years lease with them [0.9846122]
7796 I worked with JT and JD; they set me up with a nice suite [0.93071127]
7797 I recommend them highly [0.9694741]
7798 Prompton bought the building which my partner and I have lived in for three years about a year ago [0.9782255]
7800 Last summer our deck rotted and was a danger to us and the tenant who lived below [0.8854996]
7801 We requested that it be repaired and it took over two months for it to be completely repaired [0.99418455]
7803 We sent a letter to Prompton suggesting that due to the inconvenience and not being able to use our deck during the summer our rent should be reduced [0.99415934]
7804 We also included pictures of the mess left by the repairman and the poor job he did repairing the deck [0.9866554]
7805 We provided a them with a suggestion of what we thought was a fair reduction of our rent for the two months (based on the square footage of the deck in regards to the rest of the apartment and our rent) [0.9941451]
7807 Typically if the balcony is unusable it is about $50 a month taken off [0.97229654]
7809 The response was not addressed to us specifically or signed off on [0.9308999]
7810 It was simply rude [0.99422383]
7811 There have been numerous people in our building that have received similar service [0.98699135]
7812 I would not recommend renting from a building managed by Prompton [0.968994]
7813 Me & My Wife are extremely happy with Prompton as they have qualified Property Mangers who are very happy to serve you [0.98100936]
7814 My Property Manager Jennene Thomas is one of the best that i have ever met she is extremely friendly always on time and takes a lot of time explaining each and everything in details so that we are not left in doubt [0.98114043]
7815 I would like to recommend Jennene Thomas to everyone who is looking for real estate services @ Prompton [0.9660889]
7816 I am giving her 5 stars because she totally deserves it [0.96965253]
7819 I am confident that clients will be impressed by the quality of service they receive when they visit the office or kiosk location [0.4473583]
7820 My boyfriend and I recently moved into a home managed by Prompton Real Estate Services with Jennene Thomas as our lease representative [0.981009]
7822 Professionalism from the showing through to the application process and any home repair deficiencies that have come up along the way since moving in [0.74064577]
7824 If you are at all familiar with the Vancouver rental market landlords have their pick of the litter which leads to some very stressful waiting periods as you await the outcome of their tenant selection [0.9975899]
7827 Communication appears nearly instant at times and it is obvious there is a high level of client care from her and her colleagues [0.570159]
7828 The reality is a single landlord doesn’t have the strength of a full property management firm such as Prompton [0.57121843]
7829 I need my door fixed they have a door specialist [0.97884554]
7830 I need my caulking fixed they have a caulking specialist [0.9787875]
7831 It truly services us the way we should be through the residential tenancy act which greatly protects the tenant [0.99418443]
7832 As much as we are held accountable for being good tenants having a team like Prompton keeps the landlord accountable too [0.98899937]
7833 Rents are high in this city no denying it [0.96323586]
7834 Get what you deserve as a tenant and work with Prompton [0.87816805]
7836 The Prompton agent would not show me a suite in anything by work hours [0.8516568]
7837 To accommodate I left work early and due to unforeseen delays was 15 mins late and she did not want to wait [0.970471]
7838 She said it was Prompton's policy to only work till 4:45 and 5:00 was too late [0.9556574]
7839 While I understand everyone has a schedule when your job is to show places to rent to people who can actually afford it that means you need to be flexible and offer evenings and weekends [0.47054368]
7842 I suggest those who are considering renting with them proceed with caution [0.9700058]
7843 December 2013 Review: My wife and I moved from Calgary to Vancouver on January 1st and of all the rental places and property managers that we dealt with Prompton was BY FAR the most professional and organized [0.9809332]
7844 Our agent was Megan Neumann and she was fantastic [0.9601644]
7845 Punctual transparent warm energy offered alternatives and then after move in was there to address any issues [0.5316695]
7847 It looks like others have had a bad experience here which was surprising [0.8263747]
7848 Maybe it is Megan that delivered such a great experience [0.9944188]
7849 We love our new home and are totally enjoying this awesome city that feels like home more than Calgary ever did [0.9941843]
7850 Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss [0.79270995]
7852 I waited for half an hour for an appoitment that was set 5 days in advance [0.96965027]
7853 No one showed up agent's direct line went on VM [0.93551445]
7855 At first they told me she is looking for parking then they said she has claimed to have met you [0.8459343]
7856 After finally meeting the agent (35 minutes after) she refused to show me the unit because I was upset that she was late for half an hour [0.8794348]
7858 Solid company with outstanding customer service [0.6868224]
7859 We work with them as a trade with great Prompton team members including Megan Neumann and Tessa Polman-Tuin - they are constantly asking us to take care of their residents and make them happy [0.9940439]
7860 I found their representatives very unreliable and rude [0.96782714]
7861 My agent Jennene Thomas cannot be reached by phone [0.9810144]
7863 I came from out-of province just to view the property [0.9696403]
7865 Overall their agents are very difficult to get through and I am not going to be dealing with them both now and in the future [0.9697899]
7866 If they cannot even be reliable about showing up on time for viewing a property what does it say about the service they offer to their actual tenants [0.99772614]
7867 I guess my mistake is I didn't read the reviews from other people who have dealt with this company as it looks like the same problem is happening to many other people and they are not making any effort to do anything about this [0.9794784]
7870 (Translated by Google) I have lived here for a year [0.969625]
7871 I rented two bedrooms and two bathrooms [0.9696522]
7872 My rental economy Lynne is very responsible [0.98101306]
7873 She solves any problems quickly [0.9531433]
7874 The manager of this building is also good [0.4646544]
7875 Often what is missing is needed and everything is quickly resolved throughout the apartment [0.93152076]
7876 The management is very good and the furniture is complete [0.9195824]
7878 I highly recommend that you come here for long or short stays [0.9631331]
7879 I am very satisfied with the manager Lynee and Ahmed [0.6760893]
7880 They are very responsible for tenants as well as the unit [0.99836]
7881 I live here for one year and I love my unit [0.97869104]
7882 Due to my own personal reasons I need to move to other places otherwise I will rent longer than one year [0.9783396]

7887 (Translated by Google) Our experience with Sharmini Due is that it conveys warmth and confidence [0.90099865]
7888 She was always willing to clarify each of our doubts support us in the rental process even accessing an additional visit before signing the contract [0.8812411]
7889 Later when there were repairs to be made I immediately took steps to solve it [0.96895736]
7890 We absolutely recommend Sharmini Due as a Landlord when searching for a new home (in our case 11000 km away from our old house) [0.99414676]
7891 (Original) Nuestra experiencia con Sharmini Due es que transmite calidez y confianza [0.98305]
7892 Siempre estuvo dispuesta a aclarar cada una de nuestras dudas apoyarnos en el proceso de renta accediendo incluso a una visita adicional antes de firmar el contrato En forma posterior cuando hubo reparaciones que realizar inmediatamente efectúo las gestiones para solucionarlo [0.77541757]
7893 Absolutamente recomendamos a Sharmini Due como Landlord durante la búsqueda de un nuevo hogar (en nuestro caso a 11000 km distancia de nuestra antigua casa) [0.98296314]
7895 Their process is well adapted to Covid protocols - keeping everyone safe [0.98980445]
7897 I had the pleasure of working with Adam when buying my first condo [0.9787753]
7900 There were several occasions when I told him I was interested in a unit and he followed up by forwarding me very useful information on local developments in planning for that area [0.6749955]
7901 He was also very cool headed when helping me negotiate with sellers when the bidding got intensive and was very diligent in the process even at odd hours of the day [0.9214254]
7902 The firm's website is also very usable and has a very wide inventory [0.9850183]
7903 Overall the service is excellent and I will be recommending the Pospischil Realty Group to my friends and family in Vancouver [0.97846186]
7904 Charley helped me find a place to buy in downtown Vancouver [0.8454139]
7906 Throughout the whole process Charley explained what steps needed to be taken and the options I had available for each step [0.9827252]
7908 He made the difficult process of purchasing a place easy [0.9916583]
7909 The best quality Charley has is the work effort he puts into helping you secure the place you want [0.92738163]
7910 Charley helped work with me for hours until midnight on a Sunday in order to help secure the condo I wanted [0.8820645]
7911 The service provided was above and beyond anything I expected and I am extremely glad to have worked with Charley [0.985342]
7912 Charley Lee was very professional and made him self available to accommodate my schedule [0.5705742]
7913 He seemed to have a lot of local knowledge understood what I needed and stayed within my budget [0.97570074]
7915 If he didn’t know an answer to a question we had he would look into it and get back to me [0.98819876]
7916 It was nice to have peace of mind that everything was being handled as it should [0.9941374]
7917 This was our second time working with Marty and his team [0.98890126]
7918 The first time was when he helped us look for a house 20 years ago [0.9134547]
7919 He found us the home where we raised our family [0.9305811]
7920 Now the kids are grown up and its time to downsize [0.9911633]
7921 Marty helped sell the house in 7 days and was able to get us multiple offers to choose from [0.8860902]
7922 I love our home but it’s time to find another one more suitable for just the two of us [0.9483083]
7923 We for sure will ask Marty again to help us [0.9941025]
7925 You worked really hard [0.9552024]
7927 We are so grateful that we had Charley as our realtor [0.9941659]

7931 I would definitely work with Posphischil Realty Group again in the future [0.9710657]
7933 This is our first time for buying a new house me and my husband [0.9874198]
7934 We did not have knowledge at all about real estate [0.993432]
7935 But then everything got just changed since we met Charley from Pospischil Realty Group [0.99391794]
7937 That moment brought up the belief that we could ship on with him about our journey of getting a dream home [0.9989759]
7939 And when we were informed as a new house owner we felt Charley was truly happy from the bottom of his heart as well [0.9730236]

8160 The current market and what our expectations should look like [0.9452791]
8162 The whole process took 20 days from our first meeting to the date of offer acceptance [0.9699072]
8163 Our sale completed at almost 125% of our asking price as a result of the exceptional extras and efforts that the team puts into full court marketing and ensuring that the public is aware of the sale [0.9605255]
8167 Over the past few years I have purchased two properties in Vancouver with Adam as my realtor [0.97815496]
8168 After going through 3 different realtors that didn’t work out Adam was the one that finally stuck [0.9058939]
8169 I think that speaks for itself [0.9696915]
8170 Adam has been amazing always working behind the scenes and going the extra mile to get things done [0.9688096]
8172 I cannot recommend them highly enough and I will definitely be using Pospischil realty if I purchase or sell another property in the city [0.96958953]
8173 Edit: I have just sold an apartment with Adam and Marty and they were amazing [0.96962184]

8189 From managing our tenant for open houses to generating multiple offers the teams care and attention were evident [0.88064647]

8208 A team of professionals all the way through the real estate process [0.91352]
8209 A sure winner marketing strategy on point knowledge of the market coupled with professional and supportive guidance gave me the confidence I needed throughout the recent sale of my one bedroom condo [0.93013716]
8210 One week and three open houses brought close to 400 potential buyers through my door [0.97889215]
8211 My home was listed for $498,000 and Marty and Adam generated 23 offers with their marketing plan and it sold for $580,000 [0.9810342]
8212 From the very first Marty asked me to trust him [0.8453427]
8213 I did and would trust no one else; neither should you [0.96569824]
8215 I thoroughly recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell property [0.96953136]

8217 They work hard for you no stones are left unturned and this paid off in them helping us conclude a successful transaction [0.9118747]
8219 Marty and his team were able to work at lightening speed (which I think is their normal) to get our condo listed for sale [0.9697306]
8220 The weekend hosted 2 open houses and had 75 people walking through [0.9857717]
8221 We entertained 4 very competitive offers and sold well above list price with NO subjects [0.99418443]

8236 He answered all my emails promptly and kept me up to date with every step of the way [0.9585966]
8237 On the evening of the sale Marty and son Adam were very patient when presenting the offers and I felt comfortable as they made sure I understood every possible outcome [0.9615204]
8238 It was a big decision and I relied heavily on their guidance but never felt rushed [0.99331623]
8239 As an older person I would have liked more phone calls rather than emails as I am not tied to my computer as perhaps the younger generation is [0.9817557]
8240 I didn't respond as quickly as I would have with a phone call [0.96541]
8241 However the "Back office" feature was very good for keeping track of activity with my sale and I could refer to it many times as I became inundated with more activity and interest on my property [0.97868955]
8242 They really took care of me and for that I am grateful [0.84460866]
8243 We found a new property to purchase but needed to sell our current home quickly [0.99417835]
8245 Sure enough we sold in 4 days got competing offers exact terms and over asking price [0.99507654]
8246 Marty is a master of his craft and his team are true professionals [0.7691541]

8275 These are good realtors who really know their business well [0.8664248]

8353 Until I met Marty and Adam I never really thought “integrity” and “realtor” would ever be found in the same sentence [0.99875176]

8356 As a first time buyer it was a relief to have such an experienced person leading us on what can be a scary journey [0.9879798]

8360 Marty and his realty team were recommended by our lawyer to handle the estate sales for my grandmother’s and parent’s homes six years ago [0.98188573]
8361 Through the process I was impressed with Marty Adam and David [0.8136265]
8362 So when it was time for me to look for a west side home for ourselves they were the obvious choice [0.99903405]
8364 With a challenging seller the negotiations quickly hit a snag and it looked like nothing would satisfy the seller that’s when Marty and his team kicked it into high gear with a strategy meeting followed by negotiations that resulted in a win-win for us and the seller [0.95211464]
8365 Marty further negotiated for favorable resolutions to get deficiencies repaired [0.7609789]

8385 Karine Michel et Beatrice [0.99522257]
8386 As a first-time home buyer I wanted to ensure that I was working with realtors who really knew the business and covered all the bases [0.98995316]
8388 I initially met with Adam Pospischil and we walked through the first few steps of buying a home - he was very thorough and I was impressed with the knowledge he had right off the bat [0.47778192]
8389 I felt like I could ask him anything and he would know the answer or find it for me [0.83439994]

8391 David Wu spearheaded my search and tirelessly met me for open houses and viewings [0.97588223]
8392 Finally when I found the perfect home (which not many first-time home buyers get to say); his real estate prowess really came out [0.97123545]

8417 Many thank's to Marty and his awesome team [0.92791]

8427 It’s because of this honesty that when he says - go for it - you have the confidence and certainty that you’re getting a good one [0.5366445]
8430 We always got his honest opinion and never felt like it was about the sale [0.99407595]
8431 We consider ourselves very blessed to have found him [0.9941847]

8536 He is also fast acting [0.9914278]
8538 This is a long overdue review [0.9887934]
8539 I was looking for an investment property in Fall 2019 [0.9695189]
8540 Having already bought / sold homes a few times over the last 2+ decades and thus have wide experience (good and bad) with different realtors I tried to make this purchase on my own -- without a realtor [0.89613575]
8541 Long story short in the end I did work with a realtor [0.9710638]
8545 You'll get that from reading all his other reviews [0.57720274]
8546 What really stands out for me is that Pete is value-added [0.98250353]
8547 He gave me information I didn't have access to - and I'm pretty good at research and digging for information on my own [0.941032]
8549 He heard me out and understood exactly what I wanted [0.87071514]
8550 He didn't waste my time [0.9788966]
8551 He knows what he is doing [0.9914325]
8552 He has opinions and will let you know what he thinks - but he doesn't force his views on you [0.97870153]
8554 You can't go wrong [0.9314503]
8555 Two more reasons why Pete exceeds expectations and stands out from other realtors: (1) Pete understands the market; and (2) Pete knows his data [0.9437882]
8556 Pete was the first realtor in Vancouver who offered "previously sold" prices on the internet before other realtors started doing it [0.5380407]
8557 While assessed values of properties are available to everyone only realtors had previously sold prices [0.9832704]
8558 I was digging deep on google for data on my own and was able to access Pete's data even before I met him [0.9787217]
8559 It was only a coincidence we ended up speaking on the phone [0.99422365]
8560 During my search Pete steered me towards a newer / popular building with a great reputation [0.9754261]
8561 It was very nice - but I found the unit small and expensive for price per square footage [0.994124]
8562 I had wanted a larger footprint for that price [0.96963096]
8563 Nevertheless I ended up buying the newer / smaller unit in January 2020 and inherited the tenant that came with the unit [0.9705455]
8564 Fast forward to end of August 2020 - my tenant advised she had to leave [0.9788575]
8565 Given the global pandemic (and landlords in the West End and Downtown were offering first & last months rent for free over summer 2020) I was prepared to have the investment unit sit empty [0.96963763]
8566 Boy - was I wrong [0.9696524]
8567 I had a dozen queries in the first 8 hours of posting and almost 40 interested renters over 2 days [0.43229753]
8569 There was a HUGE demand and I had NO IDEA [0.986943]
8570 I found a wonderful new tenant within days after checking her references [0.9679171]
8571 Pete told me the building had a great reputation and was a solid investment for me [0.84521174]
8572 He was totally right [0.9914462]
8573 I'm not worried about having to rent that place out again if my current tenant decides to leave [0.9788913]
8574 I could go on about what a great hard-working guy Pete is - but I'm sure his clients have got that covered in all the other reviews [0.50909996]
8575 Life has been busy and we've all had our issues to deal with - but now that 2020 is finally over it will be nice to move on from last year [0.9049436]
8578 Pete helped my wife and I with the purchase of our new home [0.9787327]
8579 Buying your first house is extremely stressful and you feel like everyone is speaking a foreign language half of the time but thanks to Pete he was able to guide my wife and I into a great deal and allow us to make a great purchase [0.85072476]
8580 If it wasn't for Pete and his amazing attention to detail and persistence I know we would not have our home right now [0.99564165]

8624 Since then I have sold and purchased 5 properties in the lower mainland [0.97066444]

9011 I'm impatient extremely busy and a perfectionist - for some people a nightmare combination [0.7895334]

9020 We couldn’t be happier with our decision to choose Pete as our realtor for both our sell and purchase of our new home [0.9941743]
9023 Pete was upfront and honest always giving us different choices and solutions for every decision along the way – without the feeling of being pressured one way or the other [0.48883376]
9026 His dedication made us feel like we were his only clients when we know he was juggling multiple clients – Pete’s time management is much to be envied [0.9449494]
9028 And we have to also mention how thoughtful Pete is as he would frequently ask how our elderly dog was doing throughout the stress of the move [0.9880085]
9029 He has certainly raised the bar on the standards of realtors and we would confidently recommend Pete to anyone looking for a realtor [0.98898077]

9037 I worked with Pete to purchase my first apartment in Vancouver which can be quite a daunting task these days [0.97937953]
9038 From the beginning I was extremely impressed at how knowledgeable Pete was about each area that I was interested in and in the different apartment buildings in each of those areas [0.7307809]
9039 For example when looking at apartments that were not new builds Pete was very versed in the type of repairs/maintenance required on certain types of buildings that would eventually show up as part of strata assessments in the future [0.85022765]
9041 I ended up purchasing an apartment that I absolutely love and am enjoying sitting back and watching how great of an investment it was [0.9695389]
9044 Pete was amazing throughout the whole process of buying my first home [0.9791867]
9046 There was a lot I didn't know going into this but Pete knew it all and I completely trusted him [0.94355494]
9047 When I was ready to start looking he put together an afternoon of places saving the best for last [0.99141127]
9048 I fell in a love with a great little condo in the Lower Lonsdale area of North Vancouver [0.9696608]
9049 It was a little out of my price range but Pete negotiated me a great deal I couldn't really believe it when they accepted haha [0.9905672]
9050 He hooked me up with mortgage people and even made sure I knew about the insurance I needed and gave some suggestions [0.889883]
9051 Even now after I've moved in he's still helping me out with some questions here and there [0.8048359]
9052 Pete goes above and beyond and I would recommend him to anyone [0.969606]
9054 I was moving to Vancouver from the Northwest Territories and had a very short timeframe to find a place and close the deal [0.97195464]
9055 I had very tight search parameters in terms of location and was picky about the type of condos I was willing to look at [0.970055]
9058 He educated me about aspects of real estate that I hadn't realized I needed to know about [0.88388896]
9060 Perhaps more importantly Pete is very easy to work with [0.9262581]
9061 I came down for a three day weekend where we had over 20 showings [0.96958613]

9063 There was zero pressure [0.9962381]

9070 Pete helped me purchased my first home in downtown Vancouver I've met a couple of realtors in the past I can say that Pete is not your typical "realtor" [0.8618966]
9072 In addition Pete has a lot of connections which will make this daunting process as smooth as it can be [0.96237147]
9073 He even gone out of his way and helped me sorting out small problems after the deal was done [0.87133783]
9074 In short I chose Pete based on the reviews I saw on the internet I now believe they were genuine [0.9660698]
9075 If you are looking for a realtor who's gonna help you make the "right" purchase use Pete [0.99759763]
9076 I have and will continue to recommend Pete to anyone looking to buy or sell [0.96946776]
9077 As a first time home buyer I had the usual questions concerns and nerves but Pete was able to answer all my questions and inform me on things that I didn’t know I should be asking [0.94902426]

9083 Writing under my wife's account as mine is not connecting for some reason [0.9788737]
9084 We worked with Pete to sell our condo in Burnaby in June earlier this year [0.99419427]
9085 To be perfectly honest I have worked with and know enough realtors to know just how unprofessional and self-serving some can be - to the point that I have sold my own real estate in a few cases [0.9749309]
9087 I found Pete after looking through the reviews on a dozen or so and contacted him for an initial meeting along with one other realtor [0.83166516]
9088 I was impressed [0.79298365]
9090 With Pete we sold our condo within 6 days of hitting the market and (after 300+ ppl viewed the property through two showings and a number of private appointments) after reviewing six competing offers I'm confident we received top dollar in record timing with minimal carrying costs [0.8882812]
9091 If you're looking to work with a true real estate professional dial Pete [0.71238136]
9093 Jonathan and I had been going to open houses for a couple of months on the weekends looking at our options but not committed to the search [0.96750885]
9094 We were "pitched" by nearly every realtor we met and were completely unimpressed by most and not very motivated by others [0.99409324]
9095 After going to see one of Pete's listings he asked if we wanted to go for a drink and talk about his services [0.67861634]
9096 A few drinks later Pete had an idea of what we were looking for and we had our first date lined up for Saturday afternoon to look at a long list of possible new homes [0.9178427]
9097 We were immediately impressed with Pete's knowledge of the market and individual buildings in our desired neighbourhoods not only the ones we were going to see but every building we asked about on the way as well [0.9929899]
9098 Pete kept the whole process low pressure from our timeline our relationship with him and all of our purchasing decisions [0.9752352]
9100 He took the time to bring us to wood frame walkups townhouses in False Creek new builds presales and everything in between [0.984429]
9101 Even though we ended up right across the street from our previous place the process Pete took us through really helped us realize what was important to us all along (neighbourhood) and things we hadn't yet realized we couldn't live without (AC) [0.8950654]
9102 We found our new home on that first Saturday but Pete was patient with us as we looked around for a couple more weeks [0.9941595]
9104 He stuck with us through the inspection and walkthrough and we even went out to dinner to celebrate the day we moved in [0.8784318]
9106 My partner and I worked with Pete Shpak over the course of many months to finally secure our home in downtown Vancouver [0.98102385]
9108 He worked tirelessly to keep properties of interest in front of us [0.98285556]
9109 When we finally settled on our home at Meccanica he was involved every step of the way without being overbearing in the least [0.9933052]
9111 well after he had completed his part of the sale [0.6956982]
9112 honestly just about any question we had he was willing to find the answer including helping us secure a very tight window for move in [0.46026897]
9113 I have bought and sold numerous homes over many years and I can honestly say Pete has been one of the best realtors I've dealt with [0.9697141]
9114 I'm so impressed I have no issue having Pete represent our company when we have employees considering a move to Vancouver [0.81924176]
9115 He stands above the rest [0.9914462]
9116 We would recommend anyone selling in Vancouver to seriously consider using Mike Stewart as their realtor [0.9941834]
9118 Crucially Mike is a very skilled and strategic negotiator knowing exactly how to guide you as the seller through negotiations so that you end up with the most favourable outcome possible [0.6419267]

9122 My spouse and I first met Mike over 8 years ago when we purchased our first home in the Vancouver market At that time we really appreciated his patience and expertise [0.983499]
9124 We recently called on Mike to be our agent of choice for the sale of our home [0.9941758]

9177 We could not have asked for more from him and his team [0.9941844]
9178 We had a challenging property to sell but Mike made sure it was marketed optimally and we ended up getting top dollar during a difficult time [0.99417883]
9180 We recently used Mike to sell our unit in Vancouver and he was very helpful [0.9924358]

9197 If a building or area has problems Mike does not hesitate in sharing that info [0.43238]
9198 There were a few complexities in our buying process and Mike was accommodating in this regard being able to re-evaluate and re-start on short notice [0.9924508]
9199 I should also mention that Mike's assistant Amy is amazing [0.96867454]

9205 From start to finish in the real estate process [0.96693933]
9206 Mike Stewart and his team are plus 5 star++ [0.9079261]
9207 I had the pleasure of working with Mike for a purchase in November of 2019 [0.98115057]
9208 He is a successful realtor but that never reduced the attention he paid to my family and me [0.97285694]
9210 Our purchase had some complexities but Mike helped us navigate through them with ease [0.9601469]
9211 I would highly recommend Mike [0.96924907]
9213 Mike is the go to guy [0.9936306]
9214 He knows the market like no other [0.99148256]
9220 I had the pleasure to work with Mike to find my ‘dream home ‘ [0.978512]
9223 Just amazing [0.54795754]
9226 He responded promptly to any concern we had [0.9913671]
9227 Mike was detail oriented and he helped explaining the selling process of our condo downtown [0.9375894]
9228 We needed help to find an electrician and helped us to find one in minutes [0.9939701]
9229 I would recommend him without hesitation [0.96920407]
9230 His e-mails are informative but they seem to be marketing schemes aimed at a select few only [0.9457454]
9232 I have never received a reply back to follow up [0.9431822]
9233 Mike Stewart helped me buy a condo with my ex sell that when we split up and buy another condo for myself [0.95821124]
9234 My experience was very positive [0.98095286]

9246 This guy is a right wing nut job and hands his clients over to his assistants [0.984914]
9247 When you hire him you get 0 personal touch [0.87447476]
9249 Recently in the 2019 Vancouver Real Estate Investment Summit Mike was supposed to provide commentary on factors he thinks would influence the real estate market [0.9205235]
9250 However he took a nasty turn when he decided to engage in a diatribe against the Chinese government as an argument for why he believed the real estate market in Vancouver would rebound [0.9836457]
9252 He portrayed himself as a mercenary who relishes in the prospect of misfortune (conflict in Hong Kong) for achieving his own economic gain of having increased buyers in Vancouver's real estate [0.99050605]
9253 Both in an business and personal context I would not want to associate with this individual [0.9693372]
9255 There are many great things to say about Mike but I can think of a few that really stand out [0.9833114]
9259 I felt that I was in good hands [0.9696533]
9261 I met him in one of UBC's programs where he had been invited as a speaker [0.96960783]

9267 I can count on Mike to turn documents around quickly [0.9686962]
9268 Mike Stewart is a top-notch realtor that I've worked with for over 10 years [0.9380121]
9269 We have sold and bought many properties with him and I've always been extremely satisfied with his integrity and commitment to service and great results [0.9936576]
9270 We strongly recommend him to everyone here and we due to all of our friends on a consistent regular basis [0.994175]
9272 My husband and I had an excellent experience with Mike [0.98076004]
9274 Not only did we find our dream home but he made the process so simple [0.9639955]
9276 My wife and I have been working with Mike for almost 2 years and only just purchased our first place through him [0.9810139]
9277 He has been incredibly patient and more importantly honest throughout the entire process [0.58774734]
9279 I would recommend Mike to all of my friends and family looking to buy or sell a home in Vancouver [0.9784095]
9281 He helped us weather the volatile Vancouver housing market with ease and when the time came helped us to construct an offer that was both successful and below what we were expecting to pay [0.95353013]
9282 I would highly recommend Mike to anyone buyer or selling their house in Vancouver [0.96937007]
9283 Top notch grease ball [0.8706049]
9284 Definitely will get you the unit and price you want [0.5832101]
9287 Wearing mirrored shades so those suckers working against him never see his snakes eyes [0.97534376]
9288 Top notch [0.8582131]
9291 I would highly recommend him to family and friends [0.9687284]
9292 MIke Stewart has helped us buy and sell our home twice [0.88471454]
9294 He works so hard and made himself or his capable team at all times [0.986878]
9298 Can't say enough good things about him [0.9179398]
9303 I was actually quite surprised how much time he was able to provide considering he is a very busy realtor [0.969401]
9304 Due to Mike and his developer connections he was able to get us into a Pre-Sale that we had targeted when 2 other realtors we used could not [0.88746107]
9305 I could not be happier [0.9696522]
9306 Mike Stewart knows his stuff [0.9837455]
9308 He has great relationships with the Developers and is able to get FIRST in line with most projects [0.56758285]

9311 Fantastic to work with on the other side of the table and great mentor to many of us newbs [0.83522594]
9313 I’ve only been one for a couple of years and haven’t benefited from this crazy market [0.96722394]
9314 I have known Mike for a lot longer than I’ve been a realtor [0.9697261]
9316 I think what is being lost is why he did what he did [0.969619]
9318 There is nothing illegal about what Mike did it just doesn’t sit right with some [0.9961586]
9319 The way the government rammed this tax through also doesn’t sit right [0.98565567]
9320 This government has been doing nothing for a very long time and finally felt enough heat close enough to re-election time that they decided to take some action…way too late to make any difference for Vancouverites [0.98879313]
9321 Change the rules and have them take effect quickly that’s not really a problem but penalizing people who bought without these rules is not right [0.8786036]
9322 Trust me I think there should have been way more regulations on foreign buyers a long time ago [0.8889234]
9323 Mike would probably agree with me because despite what lots of people have been saying he’s a decent ethical guy who does not like it that home ownership in Vancouver is out of reach for many [0.85004336]
9324 We both have kids and have talked about it in that context [0.9941846]
9325 How about complaining that the Feds and the Quebec government are letting immigrant investors enter through Quebec and come to Vancouver [0.7704049]
9326 What’s the point of closing that program everywhere in Canada except for Quebec [0.52768636]

10455 He also has a wonderful team behind him [0.99037874]
10457 They were also able to act on the houses we wanted to bid on quickly [0.99820447]
10458 When we did the house inspection Ron even went with the inspector himself and did a video call with us to do the live inspection (as we didn't have time to go to the place ourselves) [0.98104244]
10459 We are so happy to get our new house with Ron and Teams help [0.9941792]
10460 They made the buying process pleasant [0.9816588]
10461 My husband and I recently needed an experienced realtor to sell our 3-bedroom Vancouver condo [0.98101306]
10462 We were so fortunate that Ron accepted to take on this challenge at the beginning of January when the market did not seem particularly favourable but what an experience [0.99089617]

10473 He was always looking out for my best interest [0.9789129]
10474 From start to finish he made the purchase effortless and proved to me what an honest and hard working realtor is supposed to be [0.7270599]
10475 Ron also negotiated my buying price for under asking in a hot market and a desirable location [0.97890043]
10477 I have had the pleasure of working with Ron on multiple transactions serving opposite me as a listing Realtor in one instance and as a buying Realtor in the other [0.88631004]
10478 Each time the process was seamless [0.9972719]
10479 I look forward to the next transaction [0.96963483]

10503 We were very happy with our decision to work with Ron [0.9941692]
10504 Ron helped me buy my first property (condo) 6 months ago but our journey has started almost 5 years ago when I moved to Vancouver as a new immigrant and dreamt of owning my own place [0.97563374]
10505 It took me a very long time to get an understanding of what sort of property I want and what are my priorities and all of that during the crazy real-estate market of those days [0.98635864]
10507 Ron is the kind of realtor who will tell it like it is and not look to make a quick buck but instead will do what is right for his client because that's the kind of guy he is [0.67551804]
10509 When I inherited my family home in the Brentwood area of Burnaby after my father's death in 2018 I had a very important decision to make [0.97880983]
10510 Since my husband and I live and work in the Fraser Valley we were not keen on moving to Burnaby and commuting further to work [0.9791235]
10511 We also did not want to bother with any renovations to the house [0.9941846]
10512 Since I have a major disability it was easier for my husband to search online for a suitable realtor [0.97873354]
10513 In late August 2018 we decided to choose Ron Parpara to help us with the sale of my house [0.9768463]
10514 The house was put on the market in early September and was finally successfully sold in April 2019 after multiple offers [0.9854879]
10515 The first offer in October looked promising but the buyer pulled out because of financing issues [0.9852332]
10517 The final offer which came in February and revised in April hit the jackpot with me and the buyers [0.8512114]
10518 After the completion date in July Ron Parpara arranged a celebratory lunch for my husband and me the buyers as well as himself and the buyers' realtor [0.9694266]
10519 It was so good to meet the nice people that bought my house [0.9894091]
10520 My husband and I are very happy and so are the buyers with their property [0.9810132]
10521 I know that they will take good care of the place [0.97017294]
10522 My husband and I are definitely pleased and very satisfied with the job that Mr [0.9809999]
10523 Parpara did to get my house sold [0.9788918]
10524 We will be hiring him again to assist us in buying a house in the Fraser Valley [0.99405336]
10526 Since I cannot text he was willing to communicate in person by phone or through email [0.6960462]
10527 He was always patient kind thoughtful and willing to go the extra miles to meet my personal needs and preferences [0.97920734]
10528 Even when he was busy Mr [0.98818856]
10529 Parpara never made me feel ignored or unimportant [0.84534323]
10532 He referred me and my husband to a real estate lawyer oil tank company a handy man and pest control company when necessary [0.97462505]
10534 Parpara met us at our home at the house in Burnaby at lawyers' offices and wherever we needed him to [0.8513066]
10536 Until I got comfortable with signing documentation over the computer Ron was willing to meet us so I could sign actual paper work which took some effort on my part [0.8955685]
10538 My husband and I sincerely recommend him to anyone who is looking for a highly skilled negotiator who does a very thorough and detailed job [0.9806127]
10540 Ron made a big impact on our family as our agent [0.9104947]
10542 He's available whenever you need him and no showing gets missed [0.5201466]
10546 As a Realtor working in Seattle I would refer Ron to anyone I know looking to buy or sell in Vancouver [0.98990816]
10550 I highly recommend Ron to anyone looking to buy or sell in Vancouver [0.96946234]
10551 I recently had the pleasure of working with Ron when I only had four days to find a house in Vancouver [0.9761493]
10552 I don’t live in Vancouver and I travel a great deal of the time so time is of the essence [0.97031015]
10553 Ron lined up several homes that met my criterion set up appointments that fit in with my tight schedule did all the legwork and due diligence necessary to make sure the home was appropriate and finished the deal [0.9576918]
10554 In all my years of working with real estate agents I can honestly say that Ron is head and shoulders above the rest and I can highly recommend him [0.97871876]
10555 We've used Ron for two sales and one purchase so far and would use him again in an instant [0.9302513]
10557 Ron's very down to earth and friendly and clearly had our best interests at heart [0.88477665]
10558 We couldn't be happier with the results [0.9941847]
10560 Ron did an amazing job helping my wife and I purchase an apartment [0.9763147]
10561 We were first time buyers and Ron kept us informed throughout the whole process providing clear instructions on what we needed to do [0.8463029]
10562 He also went above and beyond in providing us with requested information addressing any concerns we had and negotiating price with the seller [0.75507134]
10563 In the end we acquired the apartment we loved in the neighborhood we wanted for a respectable amount under asking price (Ron worked extra hard to get the price even lower even though we were comfortable making an offer [0.9462077]
10564 He unded up saving us even more money) [0.99031055]
10565 After the deal Ron helped us with cleaning and finding contractors for touch ups [0.89619964]
10566 I've already recommended Ron to a friend and they're also very happy with his work [0.53245014]
10567 A++ agent [0.8532116]
10570 He was an essential part in receiving the highest price for our home [0.99065375]
10571 I had Ron represent me as a purchaser of a 2-bedroom investment unit in Downtown Vancouver [0.90341264]
10573 We had a good discussion at the very beginning about what exactly I was looking for in the right unit [0.9941773]
10574 He tried to put himself in my shoes to understand what my expectations were [0.97895354]
10575 He also asked me an interesting question – what my backup plan would be if prices surged beyond my budget [0.97734207]
10576 It wasn’t something I had thoroughly thought over so it was prudent for him to bring that up for me to think about [0.9938326]
10577 Then came the search [0.99836206]
10579 It did take a while to find good units though due to the lack of inventory [0.9942232]
10580 We were outbid a couple of times and simply too slow in some other instances [0.9941847]
10581 Eventually we found a decent unit quickly scheduled a showing and prepared to submit an offer [0.9996124]
10583 Our offer was met with a counteroffer with a higher price [0.96016705]
10584 I was ready able and willing to meet the seller with a price in the middle [0.9696172]
10585 However Ron told me to be firm on my original price and to let him continue negotiating [0.9709544]
10586 I reluctantly agreed thinking it wouldn’t work but I was wrong [0.9704923]
10588 We had a four-day subject removal period so Ron kicked it into high gear [0.9941843]
10589 He pointed some things out in the strata documents [0.9903691]
10591 Subjects were removed and Ron continued working to ensure a smooth transition right through to the closing date [0.96740395]
10592 Ron is absolutely amazing [0.5645955]
10593 We had been trying to find a realtor for a few weeks without success [0.99418455]
10595 At the time we were out of province and Ron did everything to make this a seamless process [0.9477647]
10596 When we finally decided to buy a home we made an offer before even seeing it [0.99468833]
10597 That's how much we trust Ron [0.8083183]
10598 He would FaceTime us and take us through a home do a mini- interview with the owner [0.97869873]
10599 We would send him a list of places we liked and he would give us his unbiased opinion [0.99409854]
10600 When he didn't know he would confer with a colleague just to make sure we were getting accurate info [0.42851335]
10601 If you're considering any kind of home purchase look no further [0.9977613]

10608 Ron is a rockstar real estate agent and always has his client's best interest in mind [0.86298794]
10609 What makes him stand out from most realtors is his exceptional marketing and his social media presence [0.9827329]
10610 I've worked with a lot of agents and I've seen first hand how he takes good care of his sellers [0.9465177]
10611 Ron creates a successful marketing plan for all his listings [0.9812413]

10615 Having Ron on our side was a great way to make sure that what we had in mind was the right choice for us [0.88005286]
10617 He is very detailed oriented and he even went above and beyond by visiting some of the places that we were looking at and provided a detailed comparison with pros and cons of all the properties [0.7636135]
10618 I can't recommend him enough [0.9696447]
10619 If you are in the look for a house or property you can always count on him [0.9976249]
10620 I had the pleasure of working with Ron when he reached out to my company (Memorable Maids) to ensure his clients properties are cleaned deeply prior to listing [0.9602659]
10622 I chose Ron when we were downsizing to sell our house and buy a townhouse [0.96848685]
10624 Once I listed with him he took care of Everything [0.998517]
10626 Ron is a Fantastic Negotiator and he sold our house at a price much higher than comparable properties and over list price [0.8873572]
10627 Then Ron found us a townhouse in a quiet upscale area [0.994091]
10628 He checked the property and strata's minutes thoroughly and told us about every possible problem with it before we bought [0.9297632]
10629 He also explained other documents such as the depreciation and engineers report in great detail [0.97981316]
10630 This was very beneficial before making our final decision [0.9887909]
10631 Again he negotiated the price down and we bought a large beautiful townhouse at a price much lower than any of the recent sales [0.96210855]
10632 Ron is the Best Realtor I have ever worked with [0.98291916]
10635 He was always on time for appointments very knowledgeable to the product that he was selling and took the time to show my clients and I around the building and answer any and all questions we had [0.6811524]

10649 He met with us on several occasions and helped us find a home that met all of our needs [0.91699904]
10650 I wouldn’t hesitate to use Ron again in the future [0.9695771]

10655 Fast forward to today he’s my ‘GO TO’ Realtor for any Vancouver Clients as I’m also a Realtor in London Ontario [0.9556143]
10657 He knows more about Vancouver neighborhoods and buildings than anyone I know [0.9816768]
10659 After hours and hours of researching the plethora of real estate agents in Vancouver I was lucky enough to happen upon this Ace [0.96968585]
10660 Upon my first meeting with Ron his open and honest nature is immediately apparent and it put me at ease instantly [0.9746918]
10661 I could sense his honest desire to really listen to my specific needs and his ongoing dedication continued far beyond even what I expected [0.97693676]
10663 He has such a knack for systematically breaking down each and every step along the way leaving you always feeling informed and more importantly confident that he's working hard for what you need [0.93511075]
10664 Ron is the real deal [0.762151]
10665 His communication was constant clear and informative [0.94499177]

10673 He is also very meticulous when listing properties [0.98621714]
10674 He makes sure they are marketed and showcased effectively and distinctively online and then in person when the time comes [0.98883367]
10678 He was very patient with me as I bought my first ever home in North Vancouver [0.97306734]
10679 I appreciated that he is extremely detailed oriented and gave me all the information I needed to make my final decision [0.95045525]
10680 Buying a home can be very stressful but Ron was always there to answer all my questions and guide me through the process [0.962295]
10681 I would highly recommend Ron to anyone who needs a realtor [0.9691345]
10682 I have been living in my condo for 4 years now and I am still in contact with Ron [0.9749704]
10683 He is always available to answer my questions [0.8997947]
10684 Ron was recommended to me by a friend for my first home purchase and without a doubt Ron definitely exceeded all expectations [0.97570604]
10685 As a first-time buyer I was entering this process as a complete newbie along with a short deadline [0.9895333]
10686 Given all that Ron took the time to walk me through the whole process and showed me many properties to get a good feel for what I liked & did not like rather than just rush a quick sale [0.86266625]
10687 Once we found something that worked well rather than settle for the seller’s first ‘best & final’ which I would’ve taken given the circumstances he encouraged to play it slow through multiple expired offers over a few weeks and in the end managed to negotiate the sellers down quite a bit from list (and well under budget) [0.99122125]
10688 After that his high degree of thoroughness clearly showed as he repeatedly chased down both the seller’s agent & strata for updated documents and helped me go through every key document [0.85796475]
10689 He also researched just about everything else you can think of – he looked up the developer’s history recent & pending developments in the nearby area past & potential issues with city & more [0.9778867]
10690 Further he has a very good network of high-quality real estate professionals (lawyers inspections brokers) & tradesmen many of whom I leveraged during my purchase [0.97831553]
10691 By the time we removed subjects I was very confident with the purchase as Ron goes through pretty much everything in detail [0.91069335]
10692 Even after the deal closed Ron was still checking in & assisting [0.9828236]
10694 There was also a residual issue with a fireplace which Ron quickly resolved with the seller’s agent & arranged a prompt inspection to remove all worry [0.99434423]
10695 I quickly learnt throughout this process that it is quite easy to make costly mistakes [0.90450066]
10696 You need someone on your side like Ron who will fight for best price ensure the due diligence is done to the highest degree and make sure you are comfortable with what you purchase [0.42295188]
10698 He helped out immensely on all the various bumps along the way and even prepared me for potential issues & expenses over the next five years as well as considerations upon resale [0.86992985]
10701 We couldn't have found anyone better [0.9941847]
10706 We were looking to buy in the East Vancouver area and he was very familiar with the area [0.994184]
10707 He was great at following up with us through the entire process and even afterwards [0.9819894]
10708 We never had to chase time down [0.9941847]
10709 He also recommended lots of other great professionals for other parts of the buying process (like home inspectors reno guys etc [0.9905902]
10711 We ultimately bought in the River District after Ron took all our preferences into consideration and gave us some suggestions of places to look [0.9941361]
10712 He was very detailed-oriented through the entire process and pointed out important things for us to consider [0.974493]
10713 He even gave us a list of pros and cons of the property we were looking at [0.94677055]
10714 Even though we were willing to go higher he negotiated the price further down for us [0.92029226]
10715 There were so many little things he did that went above and beyond what typical realtors did [0.99560314]
10716 For example when we moved in the previous occupants left a large shelf and the place wasn't completely cleaned [0.90854317]
10717 He arranged for all those things to be taken care of and he covered the costs [0.99025774]
10718 Even after we moved in Ron has kept in touch and checking in to see how we are settling in [0.9808207]
10719 I cannot recommend him enough [0.9691696]
10720 I definitely will be suggesting Ron to people we know [0.96988285]
10721 I was really lucky to meet Ron and Sutton Group Del Mar when I moved to Vancouver and needed to find a new home for me and my family [0.9722165]
10723 He was friendly responsive and thoughtful throughout the whole time [0.9759907]
10725 I will certainly reach out to them again if I have the need in the future [0.96966046]
10727 It was a pleasure to work with Ron for a few years [0.9941715]
10728 He was the owner's agent for the place we rented [0.99133223]
10731 Even when the owner wanted to sell Ron was still quite respectful and supportive trying to help us the whole way through [0.8812904]

11061 He negotiated a very good deal for a superb home [0.9908216]
11063 Ron showed great talent to match the showings to the type of home we were looking for and advised us away from risky deals [0.8917974]

11077 He used his experience and expertise to help me successfully sell my condo in Lower Lonsdale and purchase one at a preferred location in Pacific Point Yaletown of approximately the same size and at a lower price [0.43587646]
11078 This turned out to be a very pleasant surprise because the prices in Yaletown are usually considerably higher than on the North Shore [0.988793]
11079 The task of selling my condo was a challenging one [0.9788742]
11080 In addition to major construction going on directly in front of my building and a dark kitchen the market had been changing and really slowing down [0.9788898]
11081 Also there were 6 other units that went up for sale in the same building complex around the same time [0.91834587]
11083 We had many interested visitors and offers that soon followed [0.9941841]
11084 My unit was the first to sell out the 7 and with Ron’s help negotiated a record breaking price which considering current market trends was impressive [0.9810133]
11085 Then he helped me locate and negotiate a corner unit suite in Yaletown at a lower price [0.99311525]
11086 Even though the contractors he recommended were hit and miss I was overall satisfied with his service [0.7228655]

11337 Gaeton is an excellent real estate agent [0.853209]
11338 It took us roughly 6~7 months to find an apartment but his enthusiasm and hard working spirit never seemed to decline [0.99401045]
11339 We looked at many apartments and although there were many miss matches it never once felt that he was trying to push me towards a sale [0.99327976]
11340 He show cased an extreme objectivity to my every request and was kind enough to give me the utmost honest opinion he could [0.96821344]
11342 However Gaeton never once fell short as a true to heart salesman and he never once put his interests above mine [0.98050594]
11343 In my opinion the only shortcoming of my experience was that I was never notified that some real estate agents refund a portion of their commission back to their clients [0.8634791]
11344 Despite this I would highly recommend Gaeton for he has exceptional customer service and a keen eye for what's hot on the market [0.9708925]

11364 I met Gaetan outside a condo he was showing me and the listing agent was a no-show [0.8818325]
11365 Gaetan apologized profusely on his behalf and offered me a drink for my time wasted [0.9706613]

11370 He knew about recent sales reputations of buildings their managements etc [0.9912771]

11393 He never influenced our decision until we asked him to do so [0.9900823]
11394 That was another reason we felt comfortable working with him Gaetan was very patient he was calm even during the buying process [0.99897593]
11396 If you are looking for a realtor Gaetan should be at the top of your list [0.5057622]
