258 So far so excellent :) [0.979876]

275 I registered a startup company with Shipbob and had a very smooth experience using their website and working with my onboarding contact Emma Hague at Shipbob [0.4790166]
279 But they never made excuses and had earnest honest answers to our questions which I respected [0.45639104]

345 Customer support has always been a bit of a challenge trying to get ahold of someone to fix issues [0.66896665]
347 Emailing takes too long because they rarely understand the issue at hand in the initial email [0.9975195]
348 This leads to multiple emails of explanation when the issue needs to be resolved faster [0.99125576]
357 Well now ShipBob has 11 fulfillment centers with more on the way [0.40274593]
364 Except one problem which required multiple exchanges and escalating to the right person - the 3rd person to look at the problem [0.7555273]

434 ecommerce is a complex world launching into a new country is even more daunting we decided on Shipbob to be our fulfilment partner to launch into the US (our origins are in Australia) [0.88437885]

443 Thanks ShipBob you've got my back [0.999426]

487 So fortunate to call ShipBob a partner in our e-commerce journey [0.40675446]
508 False [0.59643483]
513 I'm here thinking maybe working with any other reputable fulfilment centers would've been better [0.92454106]
525 I have not one phone call back [0.63441503]
532 Seriously deceptive stuff [0.82208]
534 Deceptive and unethical [0.5870685]

661 Within these weeks I have followed up again via email with no response as well as called and was met with a robot that said partners on the growth plan do not get any call support whatsoever [0.99751616]
664 Far easier than getting stuff configured at Amazon (by an order of magnitude) [0.451427]
667 I've been in the direct-to-consumer ecommerce industry for 10 years and ShipBob is the most incompetent and horrible fulfillment service I have ever worked with [0.8812567]
673 If you are looking for a fulfillment center DO NOT use ShipBob [0.40278968]

685 I have been having great response from shipbob to my requests for support [0.4719503]
697 Not kidding [0.7453165]
699 This was during a recorded call on August 14 2020 (mentioning dates cause they love to contact Trustpilot denying their incompetence) [0.4735256]
709 (email from August 21 2020) - Customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss [0.65001357]
710 - Your emails will be ignored [0.98974586]
713 - You will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job [0.99779177]
718 ( email from Aug 14 2020) Sooo am I automatically just part of the ‘whatever this happens group’ [0.99751264]
725 - “Management” will have a call with you and then ghost you [0.6276035]
727 - When I directly called them a scam (which they are) they informed me that one of their clients is Tom Brady (Instagram DM August 25 2020) [0.691407]
735 shipbob is a scam [0.7553511]
737 ***Do your research [0.8179177]
741 - Reach out to others who have used shipbob and predictably no longer do [0.8850309]
758 I trusted them because I saw that they are raked as nr 1 fulfillment in the US but it's totally opposite [0.4060346]
763 Just went through the business hours with Genari & Sai they were great on presenting info and also answering questions can't wait to work with SHIP BOB [0.95894086]
779 Every question and/or email gets answered instantly and for every issue theres a quick and effective solution [0.99751586]

805 I find their website very easy to use [0.98377794]
816 Superb [0.898645]
845 Too many issues to list all of my problems [0.6528608]
846 Almost every order is handled by multiple carriers e [0.9074605]
857 Customer response times have gone from a few hours to one-three business days [0.51549226]
859 Check-in emails asking about the same issue a few days in a row are now just being ignored [0.9910192]
860 Also don't be fooled by SLAs [0.448954]
861 Lately ShipBob has started creating Warehouse Receiving Tickets on our company's behalf moving incoming stock from an earlier ticket to a later one to comply with their 6 business day processing SLAs [0.6347137]
863 The above is happening while ShipBob is declaring new reduced SLAs as things are coming back to normal [0.42225343]
871 Thanks [0.9994263]
878 Their support team are incredibly unhelpful and you just feel powerless as they continue to overcharge you for everything and not reply to your emails [0.97161233]

905 Stay away from Shipbob [0.67172176]
922 FALSE [0.6934003]
927 Shameful if you ask me [0.7094666]
929 $50 a day for improperly labeled arriving inventory yet not a single call or specific email [0.9968137]
931 If you dont believe me - try contacting them via phone [0.8288909]
937 We have been working with ShipBob for the last year or so and so far they have done a great job for our clients looking to fulfill their eCommerce stores [0.5000452]
951 Amazon demands under a 4% late rate [0.4127315]
953 -They over-bill constantly [0.83574617]
973 The product keeps getting better and it is amazing to see a company doing such a great job for an ecommerce brand like us [0.89525414]
979 I continue to recommend them to all my tea clients who are looking for third party fulfillment [0.4073092]

1025 Very user friendly on-boarding experience 7 [0.65710574]
1044 Helpful team to help on setting up everything and also the user friendly system is fantastic too [0.64472663]
1068 During COVID times and other times we (partners) are always communicated about updates changes and such [0.5160538]
1075 During 2019 they have cheated me for more than $20 [0.65045565]
1076 000 USD on incorrect billing amounts and I have sent hundreds of emails that were never resolved [0.9908598]
1086 Integration with fulfillment and website was very transparent [0.46106252]
1087 Thanks for all you do [0.9994125]
1088 Excellent Customer Service [0.6740027]
1093 Helped me setup everything with my online store [0.8281443]
1127 I was amazed to get a email from their CEO addressing delayed deliveries due to a backlog with the shipping vendor - something out of their control but having this understanding was super helpful - THANK YOU for providing this context which I can use with my customers [0.98686004]
1138 Worst fulfillment warehouse ever DO NOT USE THEM UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR AMAZON METRICS AFFECTED [0.41999123]
1144 We got calls and emails daily with complaints about slow delivery [0.9496704]
1150 If you are looking for a fulfillment partner ShipBob is a horrible option [0.40230474]
1208 Yikes [0.9547405]
1210 So we decided to change our D2C fulfillment to ShipBob [0.40417477]
1222 I can't thank their team enough [0.9307044]
1226 With ShipBob I'm kind of in the dark [0.77437115]
1231 I started using shipbob as I needed a 3pl independent from amazon [0.8220937]
1240 they asked fro more info and I provided - still waiting for a response from ShipBob  [0.95901567]
1258 The account manager that signed my business up will not respond to any emails of which I have now sent 5 and since signing up my business to shipBob has shown no care or attention to the numerous issues I have incounterd with the business and instead I am left having to email a generic customer service account [0.9963078]
1264 Their api isn't good either e [0.9450169]
1266 they can't even accept signature confirmation instruction via the api it has to be manually selected [0.5443185]
1274 Customer service was VERY unhelpful they responded slowly each time I referenced the other 10 open tickets I had (they lost maybe 10 packages in 6 weeks) they always gave the same unhelpful I didn't bother reading your email rote response [0.99745625]
1280 I contacted support and they didn't even bother replying saying that warehouse replied saying "they couldn't be found [0.88966066]
1284 He has also been now basically ignoring my emails and saying "please contact support [0.92089415]
1285 " Thanks for nothing [0.9994263]
1289 You call the carrier and they say they never received it [0.58050525]
1294 She took the time to call me when I had issues that took too much time to resolve via email and made the extra effort to ensure that my questions were answered thoroughly [0.9975143]
1295 No complaints only compliments [0.71679264]
1299 Keep this up [0.54752034]
1319 How on earth [0.70183325]
1350 Complete Disaster [0.827592]
1387 The technology is very slick but still easy to use and when I do get stuck I reach out to Tom on E-mail and he replies ASAP with the answers and often just actions things for me if I am not getting it [0.92536247]
1392 Simply put - best in class [0.885581]
1398 They patiently walk you through the steps to get everything set up perfectly on scheduled calls [0.76973283]
1399 Thanks Melisa & Dominique [0.99940515]
1428 I’m use to a months onboarding and countless calls and tickets with other fulfillment centers [0.6571569]
1448 Thanks for being on our side ShipBob [0.99941033]
1468 ShipBob has been a great fulfillment partner [0.40179095]
1472 The user interface is straightforward and effective [0.6421368]
1473 Customer support has been very responsive and helpful in several instances [0.6704488]
1478 I recommend ShipBob anytime someone inquires about our operations [0.77515787]
1481 Speed: 9/10 - great overall a few exceptions here and there Customer Service: 12/10 - super fast and friendly easy to escalate issues and the team is open to custom solutions [0.5959143]
1493 They've made my job much easier and fulfillment much less stressful [0.40258852]
1497 My company sells simple ecommerce products often in multi-packs [0.54296595]
1499 I would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before I even received a call back [0.6141048]
1511 "We'll credit your account" - they say [0.7874933]
1515 IMMEDIATELY [0.90420705]
1526 Everyone please AT ALL COST - STAY AWAY FROM SHIPBOB [0.99782145]
1527 Just [0.8890664]
1528 Stay [0.6717302]
1534 I took the time and submitted the info requested [0.9600373]
1540 And finally this: when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved [0.9972687]
1545 EVER [0.46266553]
1552 Shipbob shouldn’t be trusted with your mission-critical fulfillment [0.40355402]
1567 Apparently some third-party sent it [0.43699002]
1568 They send us one email about it and then without ever reaching out to us again or highlighting the issue on the web portal they just billed us over $5,000 ($75 per day for more than two months) [0.99750924]
1570 This in akin to the worst kinds of predatory financial scams [0.9450711]
1592 If you choose to work with Shipbob religiously audit your monthly invoices [0.58314985]
1594 We are debating whether we should create and provide custom mailers or switch to another fulfillment partner [0.5045626]
1607 ShipBob became our fulfillment partner about 6 months ago [0.4037423]
1612 I asked [NAME REDACTED BECAUSE OF SHIPBOB COMPLAINT] sales personnel to stop contacting us and they are still sending emails and calling us [0.90175444]
1627 Has Real time updates 4 [0.6135302]
1630 Very user friendly on-boarding experience CONS: 1 [0.656379]
1634 They provide an excellent service to our sellers looking to outsource fulfillment and have a smart and highly collaborative team who work closely with us on everything from webinars to email campaigns to events [0.9945812]
1640 We selected ShipBob three years ago when we launched based on three criteria: tight integration with Shopify; ability to handle custom mailer boxes and bundles; and ability to scale as we scaled [0.69102573]
1645 Transitioning to ShipBob for all of our fulfillment needs has been a literal dream that has freed up our own employees to focus on their day-to-day jobs instead of fulfillment [0.40748185]
1654 ShipBob makes order fulfillment simple and easy [0.40293166]
1656 We partnered up with ShipBob early of 2018 to handle all of our ecommerce inventory management and fulfillment [0.87854373]
1661 Their email support is super prompt and thoroughly professional All was going great up until we started seeing in their email newsletter early this year (2019) that they're expanding their operation and this is when things got a bit rocky [0.99732697]
1677 He attended to every scheduled call with positive “can do” attitude gave us his undivided attention throughout the process and kept us updated along the way [0.63022286]
1685 Overall I would absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend ShipBob to anyone looking for a reliable fulfillment PARTNER and ready to scale their ecommerce business [0.74285024]
1696 As a growing ecommerce brand we have had many struggles and hiccups [0.8999452]
1718 I've been using ShipBob as my fulfillment center since May of 2019 [0.40116265]
1724 ShipBob’s Customer Care Team is the best [0.6719717]
1750 Terrible interface that prevented me from getting any pricing info after I chose the wrong option in a drop down [0.76857734]
1753 I contacted support through live chat [0.8902703]
1755 They said I wouldn't be contacted again [0.89021647]
1756 I was sent four emails asking for "feedback [0.99146956]
1757 " I was then contacted a day later by their business development manager wanting to know if Shipbob was the right company for my business [0.8838762]
1758 I asked him why I was being contacted why he is still using my information after my account had been deleted and asked for a link to their privacy policy and GDPR compliance [0.88137555]
1762 UPDATE: July 6th Shipbob contacted me on Trustpilot with the excuse that they "just got access to this account hence the delay" [0.7929953]
1763 They asked me to provide my "real name and email address" so they could look into this [0.99751896]
1768 Trustpilot contacted me for proof of my interactions and I sent every shred of evidence I have including the chat logs I saved and their continuous spamming of my email address [0.9974173]
1769 These people will do whatever it takes to get bad reviews off this site [0.41381794]
1772 They're also posted at regular intervals [0.8675357]
1775 They also posted a taunting reply to my review saying that they can't remove my data if I won't give them my email address (despite as verified in the initial review they abused my data when they should have removed it) [0.9975146]
1777 BEWARE [0.9810305]
1778 BEWARE [0.9810305]
1779 BEWARE [0.9810305]
1783 Shipbob has a great fulfillment center and dashboard but they have two cons (which are important to me and might not be to you) [0.4043719]
1784 #1 They lack the ability to push/sync Inventory Live with Shopify [0.62230253]
1789 To many eCommerce stores these might not be an issue [0.48722866]
1792 They are running a pretty good scam there [0.76274794]
1805 We have had to open a chargeback with our bank emails being ignored [0.98962766]
1810 Customer support has no idea what they are doing or rather they don't exist [0.6739142]
1821 Shipbob makes fulfillment as easy and painless as possible [0.4035577]
1827 always great [0.5840498]
1831 Automatic email to clients is cruelly missing [0.9974978]
1838 Dashboard was easy to use and seemed simple [0.5798138]
1844 The whole transition was handled with the involvement of several people at ShipMonk including the initial salesperson and the experience was just excellent [0.68087906]
1849 Thank you Michelle [0.9992564]
1890 All you get is an email notification and you are at liberty to refund the customer [0.99496716]
1915 I wish I did it sooner [0.93594724]
1926 I joined ShopMonk after a terrible experience with Amazon and they have been exceptionally helpful and understanding [0.4295297]
1948 DO NOT USE SHIPMONK [0.55933577]
1950 This is my break up letter with ShipMonk and I couldn't be more excited to leave them [0.6340471]
1959 RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM SHIPMONK [0.9667279]
1978 When it came to closing my account I was prepared to file a lawsuit it got so bad and I honestly wish I did [0.41493323]
1980 You read that right [0.79828084]
1986 I received quotes from over 5 3PL's and if I wasn't going with Shopify ShipBob was my next choice [0.9603767]
