Terry is knowledgeable, shows a strong sense of urgency when appropriate, gets you the information you need, ask you smart questions, and did everything I could hope from my realtor when buying a new home. I fully trusted him to represent our best interest.

We highly recommend Terry. He is personable, friendly, extremely knowledgeable regarding real estate. He does his homework and gives education opinions on properties. He understands clients wishes and doesn't push beyond that. He goes above and beyond making the process far less stressful. We are out of town buyers and working with friends who live in the Okanagan, he was able to secure the perfect home for us in Kelowna. You won't go wrong having Terry Osti as your real estate agent.","14 June, 2021",Dawn Knoll," Delta, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

I would highly, highly recommend Terry as your realtor, whether buying or selling. Making the decision to move to Kelowna and buy a new home during a pandemic could have been overwhelming. Having Terry (virtually) by my side as my realtor made this a seamless process. From explaining the benefits of each area, being available for short-notice FaceTime Video Tours, responding immediately to countless calls, emails and texts, and working through the successful offer process turned this into an adventure. The service Terry provides to his clients is superior in every way!","20 May, 2021",Denien Ford," Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry came highly recommended to me through a real-estate agent in North Vancouver. I couldn't have been happier with all aspects of his service. Terry is knowledgeable of the market in the Okanagan and went out of his way to help me make my first home purchase as a remote buyer. What stood out to me was his honest communication and strategies in the negotiation process. I would recommend Terry to anyone looking to buy in Vancouver or the Okanagan.","17 March, 2021",Nicholas Apps, Kelowna,5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry was amazing to work with. We moved to Kelowna from Ontario and he was great at providing us knowledge on the different neighborhoods. Terry also has a construction background so he is able to provide information about the house and it’s structure. He does not pressure his clients to purchase something that isn’t right for them, and is willing to take the time to find the right house. We have only great things to say about working with Terry and would recommend him to anyone looking for an agent!!","12 March, 2021",Laura Tomasone, Kelowna,5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

[NOT_ACTIVATED_USER] Our agent in North Vancouver contacted Terry in Kelowna on our behalf and right from the beginning we felt well taken care of. Terry is personable, open, knowledgeable and well organized and really cares about his clients. He took us very smoothly through the challenging process of buying a home remotely, with a tight timeline. He provided us with regular relevant listings to consider. With our regular phone calls we felt like we really got to know him. He made the most of our brief time in Kelowna to see properties and to discuss them with him. When we felt things were going off-course in negotiations, he was there to provide encouragement and kept us going. He even stepped in for us when we couldn't be there for our home inspection. We have a lot of trust and confidence in Terry and would highly recommend him.","09 March, 2021",Deborah and David North Vancouver," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Me and my husband received a reference for Terry, and we decided to work with him to help us buying a house in Kelowna. We had a very short deadline and in need to have a home in Kelowna as soon as possible. We did everything remotely, since we were living in Vancouver at the time, and Covid-19 restrictions limited our ability to travel. Terry went above and beyond to help us along the process, explaining everything to us very carefully, and even meeting us in Vancouver. He has a very good knowledge and shares everything. He is very honest about the pros and cons of the properties. We would happily recommend Terry to anyone buying a house in Kelowna.","19 November, 2020",Julia Costa," Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

As out of towners, we really needed to trust our agent. Terry came recommended by awesome realtors in North Vancouver who we completely trust so we had confidence in Terry right away. That said, we were still blown away by his service. Terry combined our wish list with his knowledge of the area and what the properties had to offer. He listened and advised us professionally and personably. We now have the most amazing home. We are looking forward to creating so many memories here. Lake Country is stunning and our move could not have been more smoothly accomplished. Thank you Terry. More than highly recommend Terry as a realtor. Theresa, Jordi + Amelia.

Terry came recommended by some of my colleagues. I am so glad that I chose to work with Terry for my first home purchase. He is very knowledgeable in both the real estate aspect as well as the construction aspect of the various homes we saw. Before stepping inside certain homes, Terry was able to provide me with an idea as to construction and material quality of the home as well as potential maintenance issues, both short and long term, that I could expect if I decided to buy it. During the viewings Terry was able to quickly point out flaws or defects inside the home. Terry took the time to understand my circumstances, and as such was very honest and matter-of-fact when we viewed homes that were just not right in terms of features, lifestyle fit, as well as price. Terry is very easy to communicate with and was very quick to respond to questions, requests for viewings, etc... I will definitely be using Terry for my future real estate needs! Thanks Terry!","02 April, 2020",Tyrone Carvalho," Delta, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

We've known Terry for over 10 years and when it came time for needing a realtor to help sell and buy a property, we didn't hesitate. Terry is incredibly professional and engaging. He sets himself apart in the industry through the use of innovative print and digital marketing tools to help sell your property. He is always on time, available to chat on the phone, via text or in person. When buying and selling real estate that involves large monetary investments, you want someone to take care of the fine details and walk you through the process, and Terry handled this perfectly. He is good at what he does...plain and simple.","09 December, 2019",A Hicks," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",4.96,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry is an amazing person to work with. We always felt like he has our best interest in mind, we never felt pressured to do anything and really made huge difference in our stress levels during this fairly stressful time. He is competent and efficient in finalizing sales and demonstrates excellent negotiating skills. He also brought in a designer to help stage our home. It’s a one stop shopping experience with Terry. He has a great network of professionals surrounding him. Every time we need to get something done, he has a list of very competent people ready to assist us. I still can’t believe how well everything worked out with both selling our old home and buying a new home.

Instead, i'll just say I have no doubts what so ever or hesitations on referring him to anyone or using his services again. He was direct, knowledgeable, upfront, friendly and quick in response.

Describing Terry as amazing is an understatement. As a home buyer with absolutely no knowledge of the process, Terry was patient and extremely careful in ensuring my girlfriend and I were making well informed decisions. We must have bombarded Terry with hundreds and hundreds of questions with each of them answered in an impressive timely manner. This may sound like an exaggeration but trust me when I say, you can contact Terry at any time of day and he will drop whatever he's doing to make sure your concerns are resolved. I fully understood why my friends recommended Terry to me and I am grateful and honored to have him as our agent.

We have bought and sold three properties over the years with Terry as our family grew in size, and he has been amazing through each sale.

Terry helped me purchase my very first property and he has made it a very positive experience for me. Terry is super knowledgeable about the real estate market, the quality of the property and how to negotiate. He gives you the most honest advice and does not rush you to close any deals that do not align with your best interests. As a result, I have avoided lots of bad properties and potentially, bad decisions. Overall, I had a great time dealing with Terry as Terry did a great job in timing the back-and-forth negotiation, and got me a great deal in the end. I also learned a lot about the real estate market and basic knowledge of property inspection from Terry, and during some open house lately, the listing agents even thought that I was a realtor myself... I'd highly recommend Terry to be your agent, and I look forwards to working with him again!","13 June, 2019",Junxian Lu," Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry exceeded my expectations in every aspect of purchasing the condo. Terry was recommended by a friend who recently sold their home thru him. They too were very impressed by Terry. I have purchased and sold numerous homes over the years; there was a lot of stress in each endeavor. Unlike my previous experiences, Terry made the process seamless. I would highly recommend him to anyone buying or selling a home. In fact my Son will be selling and buying a home on the near future thru Terry. I too highly recommend using Terry!","21 May, 2019",David Langlands," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

This is the second time that I have used Terry as my agent. Once again it was an excellent experience!! He is always available to help and will guide you through the process. No question is too small or big and he will always make time to answer your questions. Terry was able to negotiate a purchase price that was below asking price and ended up saving me quite a bit! You can tell he has been in this business for many years and is quite experienced!! I will not hesitate to have Terry as my agent in future endeavors!!

If you are looking for a realtor who is knowledgeable, has your best interests at heart and the integrity to work in an ethical yet prompt efficient manner then Terry is your man. From honest gut reactions of buyers who were genuine, to those who were not 'real' buyers, his advice has been candid and succinct.

I was extremely pleased to work with Terry as he is so knowledgeable about all aspects of the buying and selling processes as well as being able to provide insight to a building's structure/issues. This was so helpful as it kept me focused on potential properties vs. ones with issues. Also, Terry is very professional and fast with information and facts which makes for quick decisions and for seeking out information from other realtors. This was exactly the case for the property that I purchased & thanks to Terry for being on it and working so quickly with the other side, it made all the difference. I would highly recommend Terry for anyone looking for a knowledgeable, experienced and very personable agent.

Terry was instrumental in a smooth purchase of an apartment near Vancouver on short notice in November 2017. Our cross country move required numerous viewings from a distance using flexible processes (e.g. Skype) and Terry's pre advanced knowledge of the properties my wife and I were viewing was insightful and appreciated. During negotiations and contract completion, Terry answered all our questions professionally which gave us confidence moving forward with the sale. I would definitely use Terry's as my realtor again in the future.

Terry is a professional , kind and knowledgeable realtor. All along the sell and buy he was available, articulate and took the time to understand our needs and help us in the education process , providing tools, material and time. When it came to choices he knew how to listen and respond. When it came to negotiation he always knew when and how to interact.

Terry was recommended to us by multiple co-workers who have also been clients of his. From the introductory meeting to follow up questions after moving in to our newly purchased home Terry installed confidence and got the job done. Terry is always early for meetings and returns calls, emails, and, text messages right away. As buyers we were impressed with the technology he gave us access to which made our search easier and more fun. On showings Terry was always on the lookout for construction features which effect the long term quality of the home and would point out warning signs of future problems. When we found the home we wanted to make an offer on, Terry considered all factors to make our offer the most attractive to the sellers in a multiple offer situation. In my mind, this was one of the most impressive part of our experience with Terry. He knew just what to do when it came to crunch time! I would highly recommend Terry and I would love to work with him again.","04 May, 2017",Sarah Zaetsoff," Surrey, British Columbia, Canada",4.83,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry was referred to me by a mortgage specialist at Scotiabank. I was contacted the next day by Terry and we had a phone conversation that went over every detail about how we were going to market the condo, deciding on a price, taking pictures, open houses and showings. He took professional pictures of the condo and did a detailed price analysis of the building and area to help determine a good price. There was an obstacle in selling, there were power lines that ran very close to the property, which deterred alot of buyers. We had offers and Terry helped in the negotiation process so I could get the best selling price possible. We had three deals fall through due to buyers being able to get financing, and I was losing confidence that my place would sell. Terry was always very positive and confident that it would sell despite the power lines and new mortgage rules for buyers that made it difficult to get financing. He was always very quick in responding to any questions I had, by phonecall, email or text. When my place did sell, he answered all my questions about lawyers, strata and management company termination. I feel very lucky that I had a realtor like Terry that worked very hard and was confident about selling my condo. He was always very professional and friendly. I highly recommend him.","07 February, 2017",Melissa Bourcier," Surrey, British Columbia, Canada",4.96,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

In the past 4 years Terry Osti has helped our family purchase a new home and then due to downsizing requirements sell that home and purchase another smaller home. This was a challenging time and Terry completely understood and helped make us make this transition as easy as possible by also providing advice and service providers that could assist as well. Terry understood the specific needs that were necessary with the new home and researched the area that was required until the perfect place (with a community workshop) and location was found. It doesn't matter where you live and are selling, or where you want to buy, Terry is the best agent anyone could ever have and we would not hesitate to recommend Terry as the only Realtor that you need!","12 September, 2016",Denien Ford, Columbia,5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry was introduced to us by a co-worker, and were we ever glad that Terry became our realtor and real estate teacher! We were buying our first home and was still quite ""green"" on what needed to be done and what to look for in a home. Terry's knowledge of the market and all aspects of real estate is second to none! Furthermore Terry is extremely professional and always responding to emails or phone calls promptly. Whether you're buying/selling a 300,000$ townhouse or a million dollar home Terry gives you his undivided attention! When we sell and buy we're going to definitely use Terry again!","11 September, 2016",Philip Liu," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry helped us to get the highest price EVER in our townhouse complex. He also put us in touch with a wonderful staging company that helped us make our house look more appealing to more buyers. As a result we sold in less than a week and were stunned with the results. Terry advertised professionally with excellent pictures to help perspective buyers determine before they came in if they were serious. Also as important was the after sale care. Terry has been in touch over the last few years to ensure we are kept up to speed on the market and our situation in it to this day. Excellent service that goes above and beyond hands down, the best.","11 September, 2016",Jin and Brian Pitman," Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry was my realtor when I purchased my first condo and I wasn't about to go to anyone else when I decided to sell it . Everything went as smoothly as expected with Terry at the helm . He listed my condo on every popular social media site , created me my own website with video and spread the word to eveyone he knew . My condo had several hundred views within hours . We had an amazing turn out at open house so I wasn't surprised when it sold after the first weekend of being listed above list price.
With my first condo purchase , I knew what I wanted but had a hard time finding it. Terry didnt push me and lead me away from porperties that were not a good fit for me. With my second purchase , I knew the exact building I wanted to be in and the price I was willing to pay. I looked at him with pleading eyes to get it for me and within days it was mine at the right price !
Terry is the kind of realtor that is with you every step of the way. He listens to your needs , calms your nerves, he is always punctual and always puts you first. He would hold your hand if you needed him to and most important he gets the job done as fast and as painless as possible at the best price ! I wouldn't trust anyone else . He's simply the best and I highly reccomend him without hestiation to everyone I know.
Thanks so much again Terry for all your hard work , keeping me sane and going the extra mile.

We seldom write reviews but feel compelled to give a huge thumbs up to Terry! He helped us with our recent purchase during a hot sellers market. Terry is the consummate real estate professional. He took the time to first understand our concerns, then fully researched the markets that were of interest to us, and was patiently supportive during our search. He seems to truly want his clients to make a correct, informed purchase at their own pace. If a property had flaws, rather than push for a sale, he let us know that it might not be the right fit for us. Terry's construction background was valuable both in making the correct purchase decision and navigating the deficiencies walk-through. We found his system of emailing listings within our interest parameters to be a very helpful service. Communication with Terry was always straightforward, honest, and timely. We would very highly recommend Terry to anyone looking to purchase or sell a house or condo.","07 September, 2016",Ken and Lesley Elchuk," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

A huge THANK YOU, to the best Realtor in Vancouver, Terry Osti! It sold in less than a week and above asking price! Your professionalism, knowledge, expertise, patience, kindness, calmness, humour, and extra special help made this selling (and buying) experience a positive one. You made it easy. You are so much more than a realtor! You took great care of me, at times being my life-coach, therapist, tissue giver, and jester to help calm my nerves. You always had my back, ensuring that my needs and wants were your top priority. I could always reach you either by email, phone, and text and you always replied quickly and always so kind and friendly! My experience ... amazing! Thank you so much Terry, you're the best!

Terry helped me with selling my apartment. He sat down with me to come up with the best strategy. Although the real estate market was ""hot"" for sellers there is still a lot of skill in assessing the best approach including selling price and assessment of other comparable listings. I was very impressed with his his research, knowledge and ability as well as the professional relationships he fosters. Terry is extremely personable and relate-able to me, the potential buyers and other agents. Relationships are a vital part of selling. Terry has it all.

He is easy to trust as he shares a great deal of knowledge and experience from various industries and is genuinely in the business to take care of your best interests. He isn't shy about telling you everything you need to know to be sure you are getting the best deal and we always appreciated his honesty.

If I were to rate Terry amongst our realtors, he would be our top pick. Terry was genuinely interested in making the sell of our home a positive experience. He did his homework, accurately priced our home, did the work, negotiated with confidence and patience and sold our home in record time. Terry brings common sense, good listening skills and respectful professionalism to the table......a combination that isn't easy to find!","10 August, 2016",Karen Kelln, Anmore,5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry was the ultimate in professionalism. He was very patient, listened to our concerns and questions, provided the appropriate advise, and maintained a professional demeanor at all times. Terry was very involved when we finally made the decision to put in an offer on a property. He knew what our checklist was, he provided guidance and advice and was aware of our financial commitments. In the end, Terry negotiated and obtained the first condo we made an offer on. In the future, when we are ready to sell and purchase a new home, I most definitely will ensure I utilize Terry.","09 August, 2016",Douglas Gehl," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry showed great patience and professionalism during the whole year working with us to find our dream house. He is not that kind of realtor who will just push you to grab something. Terry made friends with us, tried to figure out what we exactly need. When we finally found the goal, he went all out to help us obtain that property. And we made it! Working with Terry is really a pleasant and exciting experience. Thank you Terry!","18 May, 2016",G Wen," Bellevue, Edmonton, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

Terry was available when required and handled all paperwork in an efficient manner. The properties purchased were in Langley which is our neighborhood but he was familiar with the properties and the area. Properties purchased were new but Terry was able to provide feedback on the construction of the properties and pointed out facts that should be thought of.","20 November, 2014",Silvano Maschi," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna

This was our first time to buy a property in Canada. We are newcomers to Canada and Terry exhibited a keen sense of empathy and highest degree of professionalism. He quickly learned about our requirements and circumstances and presented to us a wide range of options. We found him to be extremely honest, prompt and knowledgeable, somebody you must have on your side when you are looking for a property in an uncharted territory. His easy going demeanour and pleasant personality put us at ease while he guided us through the entire house buying process. Terry is well connected and he introduced us to an excellent mortgage broker. Overall an excellent house buying experience made possible by Terry. Highly recommended.
PS: Yes we will be using Terry again for all our future real estate needs.

Terry is an amazing agent. He is certainly very accommodating and hard worker. He makes you feel that you're always the number one Client which means so much. I've been recommending him to all my friends and will do so in the future","26 July, 2014",Medel Gofredo," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna
