Lynn helped us buy a new development and sell our current condo quickly. I really appreciated how quickly she returned our calls and emails. She really stayed on top of things with both our buyers realtor as well as the developer we purchased from, plus she was quick about getting us in to view places we were interested in seeing. She was extremely professional and the photos and materials she did to sell our condo were top notch, I couldn't have asked for anything better. She was also enjoyable to be around and we felt she was very honest with us.","19 May, 2021",Crystal Matthews,,5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Pre-sales are tricky; we bought back in 2017 (a completely different condo market in North Vancouver back then). Everything was a bidding war; just ramming straight cash just to grab some square footage. Completely happy with the outcome; Polygon ended up delaying 1 year and 3 months; however, we saved a boat-load due to the drop in mortgage rates. Definitely a silver lining.","19 December, 2020",Christine Y, Vancouver,5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn Le Drew is a dream to work with. My wife Annie and I cannot say enough good things about working with Lynn. First of all, she is a very genuine person who cares about people and wants the best for her clients. Second, she knows her stuff - I never realized the complexities in a Real Estate transaction, and Lynn took the time to explain everything to Annie and I, in clear and simple terms. Third and foremost, Lynn is an astute businesswoman who is a tough negotiator - she understands the buying and selling process. We will definitely be using Lynn in the future and will recommend her to everyone we know. We are delighted with our new home. Big thanks Lynn!

Lynn immediately makes you feel relaxed and confident in her knowledge. shes a down to earth pragmatist- there is no slick nor sense of being hustled - she felt more like the most knowledgable and wise friend I could have beside me. She gives you the time you need - never pressures. Anticipates details and interprets complex contracts.","01 December, 2020",P Lyster, Victoria,4.99,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

If anyone does not want to read my full review, the next sentence sums up what Lynn is like as a realtor: Lynn is efficient, honest, knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.
This is my second time working with Lynn and I will for sure be continuing to hire Lynn for the future. I can recommend Lynn to any one of my friends and family without hesitation, and anyone thinking about working with a realtor should work with Lynn. Lynn is transparent and honest about any issue or decision and I do not think I could have completed the sale this quickly without her. Even during this pandemic time, Lynn was able to get my property sold within the week it was listed, for exactly what I was asking for, nothing else I could possibly ask for. Lynn also practiced safe COVID protocols to ensure my family was safe and comfortable. Lynn exceeded every expectation I could have. I do not give good reviews lightly and I am certain that anyone who works with Lynn will be more than satisfied with the excellent knowledge, efficiency, and hardworking attitude that Lynn has.","17 November, 2020",Adrian Lee, Coquitlam,5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

We had a wonderful experience with Lynn who is a seasoned veteran and an all-round professional. The home buying experience in pricey Vancouver during a full blown pandemic was harrowing by itself, but Lynn managed our expectations, our needs and our quirks extremely well. Lynn steered us in the right direction and had our best interests in mind always. What we truly appreciated was her unbiased opinions about each property we looked at, listing out the pros and cons that often eluded us. There was one property that we fell in love with but later came to know about challenges with strata insurance and Lynn did her due diligence on the summary of risks that we were able to make an informed decision. Those are qualities that we cannot be thankful enough for and would highly recommend Lynn to any prospective home buyers out there looking for someone to truly be in their corner!","09 October, 2020",Mel George," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn is professional, experienced, helpful and offering services more than a real estate agent can provide. I didn’t know Lynn until I saw her in a website and started inquiring her about the real property market in Vancouver. Due to the covid-19, I was in overseas and could not be able to come to Vancouver and view the property myself, Lynn offered to go and inspect the properties I shortlisted through MLS. She took pictures, videos and sent over for my review. She discussed each and everyone with me in a thorough manner and she gave me her comments too. She worked very hard and showed her professionalism in negotiating the price, in drafting the agreement, and in all other services such as legal, property inspection, insurance etc. after the agreement has been made. When I took possession of the property, she was so kind to help me getting groceries for my 14-day self isolation period. She is kind, considerate, knowledgable and very responsive. I’m totally satisfied with her performance, and I’ll continue to have her as my agent for my future real property activities.","31 July, 2020",Matthias Lee," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn supported us for years - from the purchase of our pre-sale condo to the long a waited delivery. She was always available for questions or helping us getting answers from the builder. She kept track of all key dates for us and prepared all amendments & documents very promptly. As it was our first purchase, having Lynn review Amendments so we could make sense of them was crucial. Her experience was also extremely valuable during our walk-through, where she would notice defects immediately. We feel Lynn was super-pro, available and dedicated for this buying experience - even if it took years to get the keys.

Lynn is knowledgeable, professional and very helpful as our buyer's agent. She went through the contracts line by line with us and also provided great support on contract negotiation, open housing, new home walk-through and etc. Definitely recommend Lynn if you are in the market of pre-sale condos or assignments.","02 August, 2019",Zhiyong Cheng, Vancouver,5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

I was new to Vancouver looking for a place in an area where there wasn’t much available. Lynn helped me broaden my search criteria and find a place that met most of my requirements. She also helped me negotiate an excellent deal that was far below the asking price and value of the property. She took the time to explain things that needed explaining and always responded quickly to calls and emails. I wouldn’t hesitate to hire her again or recommend her to anyone else looking for a place to buy.","30 June, 2019",Gabriel Smith," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",4.99,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn was wonderful. We had no idea how assignment sales worked and she explained that to us in detail. We tried to use a couple of realtors for this transaction before meeting Lynn, but we just didnt feel confident in their ability whereas we left our first meeting with Lynn feeling she was experienced, knowledgable and could answer any questions we had. She stayed in touch regularly, sold our assignment property quickly and got us a great price. The assignment has now been completed and we couldn't be happier with her services. We would highly recommend Lynn to anyone thinking of doing a real estate transaction of any kind.","29 June, 2019",Sue K, Westminster,5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn was very helpful in every aspect when assisting us with the search for investment properties and completing our purchase. We were particularly impressed how quick she has always been in her response and availability, via text, email and calls. She is also very patient and understanding, and respects our individual style and needs. We have been working with her for the past 3 years and she is always ready to provide best service possible. We have recommended her to several of our friends and family. She is very knowledgeable and follows current market information she continuously shares to keep us informed. She is also a pleasure to deal with and has a nice sense of humour, understands people of different backgrounds, age and ethnicity.","29 June, 2019",Ania and irek G., Westminster,5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

I'm glad that I chose Lynn as my real estate agent to help with my first home purchase. She ensured that she was always readily available for us and accommodated to our schedules despite being on vacation. She made us a priority throughout the entire process. She is knowledgeable in the real estate market within Burnaby and the Vancouver area. Lynn always answered our questions via text, email or text within a timely manner. In addition, she made it convenient for us using apps such as DocuSign instead of coming to sign the papers physically. She guided us through the complex process of buying a home without any pressure of purchasing. She goes above and beyond for you. She always came prepared with questions for the listing agents, researched the buildings that we were interested in and gave her honest opinion. I hands down recommend Lynn, she is an amazing real estate agent. Thank you, Lynn, for help finding my dream condo.

Lynn has represented us in three real estate transactions, and we’ve always been delighted with her service. Most recently, she helped us sell our condo in Vancouver. The photography and video assets she produced for the listing were part of a marketing package that also included search engine optimization, which combined to really make our place stand out from the crowd and generate a lot of traffic to the open houses. If you are looking for a savvy, hands-on realtor to represent you on either side of the table, definitely consider Lynn.","20 October, 2018",Brahm Segal," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",4.86,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn was an amazing realtor. I was a first time home buyer and had zero knowledge regarding properties. Lynn sat down with me for an hour with no pressure of commitment and explained to me everything I needed to know. Lynn was very genuine and had completed my transaction in a very efficient manner. I would recommend Lynn to anyone I know and would definitely use her in the future when I decide to upgrade or anything property related. Lynn was available by phone and email 24/7 and due to the circumstances of the property I bought, Lynn was able to complete the transaction within days which was what the seller wanted. Although rushed, Lynn still provided me with all the information and was transparent throughout the process. Lynn brought me to a few open houses as well on her own time and set those up within hours and gave honest opinions when she did not like the property. 10/10","15 August, 2018",Adrian Lee," Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada",4.93,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn, kept us very well informed of properties that would be of interest to us through her website. She was diligent in answering any of our questions and offered good advice around what would be suitable for us.
Lynne was always willing to meet up with us when we wanted to view a property and was very patient with our multiple requests for viewing. She always managed to meet up with when we arrived from out of town to view properties.
When we were ready to make an offer she was prompt in providing all necessary forms and documents for us to view. She also enabled us to make our offers on line so that we could avoid a further trip to Vancouver.
In all we found her very professional, very helpful, and very patient.","10 October, 2017",Mary and David James," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn was really great with neighbourhood & industry knowledge. She was always available to us whenever we needed her and worked hard on our behalf.

Lynn is really a great real estate agent. She got us townhouse 6 months back but the most great part she always stay in touch. Its not like she got you done and her job is over from one side. Second great part about her she always take initiative to solve the problems of her customers. She is punctual, soft spoken and with great customer service. She takes customers problems as her and make dream of buying house to reality. I always found her spreading positive vibes around. She always comes fully prepared with great knowledge about the houses she want to sell related to the neighborhood info as well.","31 March, 2017",Sakshi Sethi," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

I contacted Lynn regarding a pre-sale development and she instantly helped us obtain an appointment for the VIP pre-sale. She was very thorough in going through the process and knowing what to expect. While our future protery was being built, Lynn kept us apprised of all the milestones of things to do in preparation for the completion & possession dates. Even with some last minute complications from the developer's side, Lynn assisted us in making sure everything went smooth under very limited time restrictions. I would highly recommend her services as she is very easy to reach throughout the day and knowledgeable in the market, especially in the pre-sale side of real estate in Vancouver.","08 February, 2017",Brandon T," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Excellent service and professionalism by Lynn. Lynn was sincere and helpful from beginning to end. Just the type of person you need when looking for your home. She was flexible with timings and availability when I requested to visit the property at the weekend. She gave us her honest view which helped us taking informative decision. Would definitely recommend. 10/10

We contacted Lynn through an email. From our first email itself she understood what we were looking for and our expectations. Even though we did not confirm her as our realtor, based on our requirements she kept educating us through emails. Finally we did meet her and she was easy in her approach and very professional. She did represent as well and made prior arrangements with the properties we wanted to see. Even though I guess her area is more core Vancouver, she showed us South Surrey like a Pro. Driving from anything was never an issue for her. The Best thing, She gave us our space. We highly recommend Lynn and being the professional that she is, She adapts to her client's style quickly. I wish her all the Best and will be her supporter always. And Oh Yes! We did find our Home through her :)","13 October, 2016",Bharati Ashutosh," Surrey, British Columbia, Canada",4.53,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"

Lynn was able to spend a good amount of time with me, educating me about how to go about the buyer's market. I learned a lot of information that I did not know before and it gave me important knowledge going forward. She was very flexible about the types of homes I was looking for and kept me up to date.

Lynn was a great help in finding our new Home. She was very professional and on top of things. She made sure we had a big selection of homes to visit.
She would make every adjustment to our requirements without hesitation.
Lynn is not one of those agents chasing the money. She focused on our needs.

Thank you for the service you provided us in our apartment search. We wanted a buyer's agent, and we really got one! You went above and beyond the call of duty. Your patience is amazing, and your knowledge of the local market, as well as the legalities and procedures involved in a home purchase, is truly encyclopedic. As if that weren't enough, you offered us advice after we've bought our place.

Lynn provided us with clearheaded and timely advice throughout the process. She generated comparable pricing reports that helped us understand the value proposition for listings that interested us. She also rapidly digested multiple sets of strata documents that are central to condo due diligence from a buyer's perspective. And she is a forceful negotiator; buyers need whatever advantage they can get in this overheated sellers' market. We are veteran real estate buyers but are new to BC and couldn't be happier to have had Lynn on our side of the transaction.","05 July, 2016",S Skaalum," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities"
