Heather and Brandon are the best realtors that you could ask for. Highly knowledgable, responsive 24/7 (I’m talking 11pm texts!), and a genuine care that far exceeds expectations. We interviewed a few realtors and all were lovely and personable. We chose Heather and Brandon because they took the time to educate us at the very beginning, as new homeowners, and had the go-go-go attitude that we knew we would need. And we were right - with their help we found our first home after only 2 weeks of viewings. We couldn't be happier! Heather also gave great advice about how to spruce up the place for safety, aesthetics, and resale value. Brandon spent probably TONS of hours going through strata documents in such detail and providing comprehensive notes that gave us confidence and peace of mind. I would not hesitate to recommend HofVan to anyone who is serious about finding the right property.","31 May, 2021",Melissa Wong," Hastings, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

There is no one better than Heather and Brandon when it comes to real estate! As a first time home buyer with little knowledge buying real estate, Heather and Brandon were key in offering advice, market intel and overall insights into how buying/selling works. Their deeply personal approach and years of knowledge make them a true asset to anyone in the market. I cannot thank them enough for educating me on all things real estate and providing the expertise behind getting me into my first home!","08 December, 2020",Gabriela D,,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

We came in with absolutely no knowledge of how to buy a home outside of vague terminology. Heather walked us through every step and made us feel comfortable with our choices even in stressful situations such as when we ended up in competition. We always felt as though they were looking out for us first and not just seeking a payout. As first-time homebuyers we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. When we buy again, we’ll be back!","02 November, 2020",August Evrard,,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

I am so thankful and grateful for the level of service, professionalism, and expertise Heather provided throughout the whole purchase process. Heather works hard for her clients and puts their best interest first. I was extremely impressed with her market expertise, communication skills, and negotiation mastery. She was able to negotiate the purchase of my home way below list price! I honestly cannot thank her enough for helping me buy my dream home and for allowing me to start this new chapter in my life. Heather was such a pleasure to work with and I am incredibly fortunate to have worked with her. I highly recommend Heather for anyone looking for an experienced and honest real estate agent that works with integrity.","26 September, 2020",Tyler F, Rosser Avenue,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Brandon and Heather are absolutely fantastic at what they do! From not knowing anything about purchasing a home, they clearly provided me all the information on costs, the buying process, and market data at the very beginning so there were no surprises down the road. I would not hesitate to use them again in the future. Brandon and Heather are 1st class professionals in the business. Their experience in real estate and connections in the industry truly benefits their clients, and it made finding my dream home a great experience.","16 August, 2020",Chris W, Burnaby,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

[NOT_ACTIVATED_USER] Heather and Brandon have helped us to buy and sell three times and each time they remind us exactly why we want them on our side. They go above and beyond, never stopping until they ensure you are fully informed and and fully comfortable in your decisions. This most recent purchase was complicated and full of unknowns. They worked their magic to make sure things were as clear as they could be, and brought in other experts to help us weigh in on our ultimate decision to enter a multiple offer situation, which ended up in our favour. Then we needed to list our current home. What might have been stressful was smooth, even during these uncertain times. They ensured our listing was well-positioned and that showings were organized and safe for everyone. We shined and got multiple offers and a sale within 8 days of listing. They are easy to work with, market savvy and the hardest working team we know. We recommend them all the time!","05 July, 2020",Renee Schickler," Vancouver, Nova Scotia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather was perfect to work with as my wife and I were looking for a newer home after living in our current home for twenty-three years. Very prompt in replying to emails, phone calls and other communication. We were impressed with her professionalism and candor. Heather knows the market we were looking in and set expectations very quickly. She was patient with us and learned our buying criteria quickly. We are very happy she is our agent and would recommend Heather to anyone.","27 June, 2020",Randy Schisler," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Recently I assisted my 81 year old uncle in selling his Vancouver condo. Heather Mah and her team handled the entire listing and sale remotely as my uncle had moved to Vancouver Island to live with me. Both he and I are very impressed with her! He writes ""Heather did a very thorough job for me. She is very helpful and considerate - keeping me informed and dealing with every aspect of this sale. She helped me so much with the readjustment of leaving my home and moving to my new location. I am grateful! This is the second time I have used her service, and I would definitely have her as my realtor again! I highly recommend her as a wonderful agent to handle your real estate affairs.""

From the very first meeting we had with Heather and Brandon, it was evident that their expertise, professionalism and diligence are above the rest in the business. They served as an outstanding support team, in every step of the search and purchase experience that finally led us to find our dream home. Both Heather and Brandon are knowledgeable, patient, have a great eye for detail and are always one step ahead with the information needed. Together they really make a dream team!

My wife and I just bought our first condo and I can say that Heather and Brandon are the best in the business! Their knowledge, patience, and diligence led us to our dream home. As first time home buyers, my wife and I were new to it all. We had to learn everything that is required to make an informed decision about purchasing a home. Heather and Brandon were there every step of the way. How to walk through a unit, what to look for when reading an MLS listing, finding a great home inspector, and everything in between, they showed patience and never pushed us beyond our comfort. They built trust with us over a period of months while looking tirelessly for our future home. My wife and I had a very particular area of Vancouver that we wanted to live in. Beyond our preferred neighborhood, we had our eyes on one particular building as our ideal. When a unit in that building was finally listed, Heather and Brandon had arranged a viewing within the hour. After viewing, our trust in them helped us to quickly make an offer on our dream home. Navigating through a multiple offer situation late into the night, Heather and Brandon remained firm on our price when we were uncertain. They were able to back our offer up with data - the type of building, previous units sold in the area, etc. In the end we finalized the sale as satisfied buyers. We cannot recommend Heather and Brandon highly enough and we are happy that our relationship will continue far into the future. They are helping us plan renovations to the unit prior to us moving in, and they will certainly be our choice to represent us whenever we choose to sell in the future.","16 March, 2020",Neil Power," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather is very professional. She is well organized, respectful, and always has your best interests in mind. She caught on very quickly to what we were looking for and then promptly (pretty much next day). Had a number of quality locations for us to view. Heather provides valuable input and advice based on her years in real estate. This was our first new purchase in many years and she walked us through every step without so much as a hiccup.

Deciding to finally purchase a home after 16 years of “waiting for the right time” was a big decision for our family and team HofVan were great through the whole process! Heather & Brandon are professional, supportive and were always there to answer any questions. Follow ups were always dependable, time managment always respectful and expertise advice provided was beyond priceless.

Heather was always on top of everything from providing answers to all my questions to looking into permits (essential!). She got to know my personality and needs to help find the right house for me. Heather fights for the best price for her clients - it was her idea to negotiate more money off the purchase price after my home inspection as the price that I was paying 'did not sit right with her'. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a realtor.","09 October, 2019",Craig M, Burnaby,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

I only have great things to say about Heather. Not only is she incredibly knowledgeable in the real estate industry, but she is also so positive and fun to have help in the search for a home. I luckily had the opportunity to work with her in buying and selling my first condo, and most recently purchasing my first home with my partner. She was available the duration of every time I worked with her (even during her vacation!) with potential situational risks and progress updates along every step of the way. Heather goes above and beyond when it comes to advertising the sale of your home by providing staging tips, floor plans, video, brochure and detailed information about surrounding amenities and schools. She is always thinking about her clients by making sure to have snacks/drinks available during long days and evening house showings. I can say without a doubt that Heather is one of a kind and truly cares for her clients. I am so grateful to have her in my corner in all of my real estate experiences as she was an immense help and her services left me satisfied every time. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone who is looking for a real estate agent.","08 October, 2019",Natalia de Sousa," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

My wife, 14 months old son and myself are so grateful and thankful to Heather and Brandon. After so many months thinking of selling my apartment I decided to called Heather. I met Heather 10 years ago when she helped me buy my first place. Heather and Brandon went to my place to explain the selling and purchasing process. It was AMAZING the way they showed us how to organize and stage our home. The apartment looked GREAT! So many buyers came to view. I really liked how they took care of everything. They were always there for us showing our condo to buyers and helping us look for our new home. They sold the apartment so fast and did everything possible to help me buy the place we like so much. It is amazing how they do everything possible to help their clients get the best home in our price range. I am a young husband and father without family in Canada. They were always there for me and my family. For me there is no word how to explain and thank them. I would recommend Heather and Brandon to any family looking to sell and purchase a new home.","07 September, 2019",Cristian Vides," Westminster, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

It is a pleasure to know Heather Mah and to have such a knowledgeable realtor guide us through both the successful sale of our home in Vancouver and subsequent purchase of an apartment in Burnaby. Heather was with us all the way through, for example with suggestions of how important it is to have a qualified Home Inspector and to obtain detail documentation on the condition of the property. Heather also advised us on many other matters that were so helpful in leading to a final and happy conclusion.","14 August, 2019",Eric Dent," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

We met Heather at an Open House and found her to be knowledgeable and friendly. So, when it was time to sell our house she was the first person we thought of to help us through the process. Heather is very professional and understands that selling a home can be stressful for the client. She was very proactive with advertising and showings, and was able to lighten the mood with her humor when we were fortunate enough to find ourselves overwhelmed with a multiple offer situation. Although the house sold a couple of years ago we have stayed in contact with Heather and will very likely request her assistance with any future property transactions.","22 February, 2019",V L," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Below is the thank you letter we sent to Heather after she supported us in successfully selling our home and purchasing a new one. Dear Heather, We cannot thank you enough for your professional and immeasurable assistance in the recent sale of our home and acquisition of our new one. We were so pleased with your support, guidance and attention to detail over the past several months. The process of simultaneously buying and selling a home is tedious and emotional but your flexibility, expertise, compassion and faith enabled us to go through the process smoothly. Your determination, strong advocacy and creativity enabled us to stand out among the multiple offers during the purchase of our new home. You shared our lives with the sellers in a caring and compassionate manner, reassuring them we were the right couple to continue loving and cherishing the home that they had worked so hard to nurture over the years. In terms of selling, you effectively advertised our home and listened attentively and empathically to our needs and expectations regarding showing our home. You were personally responsible for arranging the open houses and contacting the appropriate contacts to organize all the documents, which resulted in an expedient sale. Your professionalism, positivity, openness to answering our questions and knowledgeable advice provided us with encouragement, reassurance and confidence. Your passion for real estate, humour and fun-loving nature also made the experience enjoyable and manageable. We appreciated your ability to listen openly without judgment and provide constructive feedback, ever mindful of our needs.

I have been working with Heather Mah from Remax since I purchased my first home in 2005. When I was selling she was the first person whom I turned to for real estate advice. She not only advised me as a realtor but supported me as a person. From that moment on she made a life long client in me and I constantly refer to anyone who will listen! When I was ready to purchase my current condo, without hesitation I contacted Heather! Throughout the process, Heather remained strong and kept me focused on the practicality of my purchase rather than how cute or not cute I thought it was. I remember one of the selling realtors stating ""She sure has champagne taste on a beer budget!"" and Heather turned to him and said ""We will find what she wants"". Thanks to Heather and the timing of the market I was able to cash in on a great deal and bought something better than I could ever have dreamed of! Thanks Heather you are the best!","23 December, 2018",Chantel Jones," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

My husband and I would still be going to open houses and dreaming of owning a house if we didn't meet Heather. The idea of selling our 2 bedroom condo and buying a house has been on our minds shortly after we had our daughter, but coming up with an action plan didn't happen until we met Heather at an open house. She was knowledgeable, friendly, and approachable. We immediately felt comfortable with her and shortly afterwards entrusted her with the most important sale and purchase of our lives. She made the process less intimidating and was supportive 110% throughout the whole process. Not only was Heather able to quickly provide us with the most current information to help us make informed decisions, but she was always proactive and forward thinking so we didn't have to think or worry about what steps we need to take. She definitely lives up to her motto of exceeding expectations! I would recommend her to family and friends without any hesitation.","21 December, 2018",Diane Cho," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather was our realtor for both buying and selling our home. She is honest, professional and committed to getting the best results for her clients. When we were selling, she helped us stage our place to make it as attractive as possible to prospective buyers. When we were buying, she provided us with a lot of valuable information about what type of home would best suit our current and future needs.
She was able to figure out our needs by getting to know us on a personal level. I was really impressed by her prompt response to the many questions we had throughout the buying and selling process. She is also very caring as she made sure we were happy with our decision.
We were able to sell our place at the price we wanted and buy a place of our choice with her in a very short period of time. We would highly recommend Heather to anyone looking for a realtor.","14 December, 2018",Lindsey Syal," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Thank you, Heather!!! You did a fantastic job of selling our rental property. We were amazed at how quick it was, in only 5 days you had it sold, at a great price. You are a very cheerful, controlled, conscientious, professional and positive person. We will recommend you to our family, friends and to anyone else looking for a real estate agent.
We have dealt with other Real Estate Agents in the past and I can assure you that Heather is totally awesome and the best; she is a caring, hard working, organized and a pleasure to work with. She updates and Informs you of the status of your property in a timely manner. Heather investigated the history of our house at City Hall, and obtained the permits and inspection reports. She is detailed and forthright; addressing her client's needs and wants.
She works with you, as a seller, we never felt pressured or rushed. When she was with us she focused on us at all times. Even our tenant of the house for sale was impressed with the way she handled herself in preparing for an open house of our property. We recommend Heather with no reservations whatsoever. We will definitely use her excellent services in the future.
Thank you very much,

We are lucky (and smart) enough to have had Heather as our agent on two sales and two purchases so far. She is the right person to have on your team. In between searches, she talked us through our occasional temptations to sell our condo and made recommendations on renovations. When it was the right time to trade in our tiny condo for a townhouse, she sprang into action. We had a quick turnaround for getting our place ready to stage and when we listed, she had everything ready (including professional photos and measurements and strata docs) for any interested buyers. She helped us keep our showings to a minimum (we have a toddler) and set us up for multiple offers. A week after listing, we received seven offers and $36K over asking, thanks to her time and effort to get the price we did. We are ecstatic. Finding our next home was a stressful and fast-paced exercise in the hot market we had our eye on. Whenever a good-looking listing came up, she was already looking into it before we even had to ask. She kept our non-negotiables in mind and was available for same-day showings with little notice. She did her homework so that we were prepared to view the properties with context. She guided us through two unsuccessful bids, always keeping our best interests in mind. When the third offer situation came along, we were heading off on vacation, so she got us an early showing, got the strata documents for us to review and even attended the home inspection on our behalf. She advised us on potential risks and chased down inconsistent information. She went above and beyond (as she always does) to present our best offer and was available to answer questions every day at any hour. Even after our offer was accepted (hurray!) she worked to make sure the sellers dates lined up with our buyers dates so that everyone 'won'. We never hesitate to recommend Heather to family and friends. She'll always tell you what she thinks, she's a tiger with a big heart. She'll be your biggest cheerleader once you make an informed decision, because she wants you to be happy clients with the home you deserve.","12 December, 2018",Renee Schickler," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather Mah is an extraordinary realtor who carries her passion for the ""clients experience"" throughout the entire buying/selling process. An authenticate professional who treats every client like a family member, every client as if they are her one and only. It takes a seasoned professional to truly hear and understand the needs of her clients. Heather managed my last purchase and I can honestly say the journey she created was mastery in motion! She heard what I was looking for, was able to locate exactly the type of property I wanted, negotiated the right price, researched the property/determined market value and condition all within an extremely tight timeline and competitive environment. She is a master of relations and negotiations, the seller was just as pleased with the way the transaction was handled as much as I was, the buyer. Heather created a win-win as well as a client for life! I give Heather my highest recommendation and a special thanks to her for making the home buying process such a positive and memorable experience!","12 December, 2018",Corinne S.," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Amazing, Amazing, Amazing - Is our first thought of Heather Mah. We became friends with Heather when she moved into our neighbourhood. When the time came and we made the difficult decision to sell our family home we turned to her on a professional level. From the moment we said go, we couldn't have put our trust in a better realtor. Her caring, reassuring support made the procedure as easy as possible. The countless hours and hard work she put in went above and beyond our expectations. Every detail was meticulously carried out keeping us well informed on all aspects of the process. With her extensive knowledge and guidance we were able to complete the sale in a very short time. Now we are in the market for a new home and without any hesitation we have enlisted our little Ninja to continue the journey with us. We would be lost without her. We will ""sing her praises"" to anyone who asks. Remax is very fortunate to have such an outstanding, dedicated, personable agent on their team.","12 December, 2018",Louise Gilmore, Burnaby,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather Mah was recommended to us by friends who had been thrilled with her help in selling their home. She more than fulfilled our expectations. We had owned our home in the Government Rd area of Burnaby for over forty years and were understandably emotionally attached to the home and the area. She dealt with these issues in a caring and professional manner,especially,when dealing with my husband who was very apprehensive about the whole process. She walked him through every issue,late night phone call and coffee shop meeting! I would recommend Heather to anyone looking to buy or sell their home as her professionalism and her warm personality make it a pleasure to work with her.","11 December, 2018",Susan Donaldson," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

It is with great confidence that I recommend Heather Mah as a real estate agent for anyone searching for a dedicated professional to assist them with the sale of their property. I have used her several times and as an out of town property owner, when I recently decided to sell my investment property in the Port Moody area it was critical that I have a professional willing to go the extra mile to ensure the property was in top shape for sale! I found Heather to be a highly competent professional who was always available when I required information. She returned all phone calls and emails promptly. Heather was honest and forthcoming with her evaluation of my property which I appreciated given it was rented for a number of years and I wanted to complete a sale in as short of time as possible and was not looking for someone to list high and have the property sit on the market. Upon listing my property Heather dealt with ensuring the property was in top shape for showings and took the initiative to ensure, among other things, that all lights were in working order prior to taking listing pictures. Heather also spent a number of hours cleaning the condo ahead of showings including thoroughly scrubbing the many layers of grime off the shower stall left by less than caring tenants. When we received an offer after a little over a week on the market, Heather worked to ensure the deal was closed with minimal back and forth at a price that was fair to both parties. Ultimately the sale was completed in 10 days when the average selling time for similar units in the area was approximately 90 days. I am pleased to recommend Heather Mah to anyone looking to buy or sell a home. She is one of the best in the business in my opinion and I would not hesitate to use her again in the future.","10 December, 2018",Kent McParland," Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

I met Heather about 2 years ago and must say certainly lucked out. If you want someone that is going to work for you Heather is the gal. I truly feel that she was there for me in the selling of my house and the purchase of my condo. Heather was on top of all paperwork and any questions I had were answered quickly. She went through all the strata meeting reports and brought anything up that I surely would have missed. Also explained ""strata"" to me as I had never lived in a condo before. I would recommend Heather to anyone thats anticipating either selling or buying a home. She is a marvelous person and I now consider her a friend.

Heather helped us purchase our first home and to recently upgrade to our current home. Throughout each process, we relied on Heather's meticulous attention to detail, her vast knowledge of the real estate business, her shrewd negotiation skills, and her sound rational decision making. She was always available for questions and to help us think through the implications of our decisions. We trusted her completely and were impressed with her ethical manner.

Caring, meticulous, involved, dedicated, professional, thoughtful, connected… are just a few of the words that come to mind when we think of Heather Mah. She is more than your real estate agent, she is your adviser, advocate and friend. Heather saw us through the journey of buying our first home together as well as selling our condo. From the first day we met, she was honest with us creating an open communication that took us from our original vision to a place we love calling home. Invested in every viewing, we have a fond memory of Heather climbing a couch to see into a crawl space, as well as looking in every nook and cranny there was to view. Our time with Heather from start to finish, and even after we had signed the last paperwork, has been nothing short of wonderful. Thank you, Heather for showing us that buying and selling a home can be a flawless experience.","27 November, 2018",Carey Yuen, Vancouver,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Integrity. Honesty. Professionalism. If these are three of the characteristics that you value in a person, then you have found the right agent. If you have read other referral letters about Heather, we experienced what those letters wrote about. We were referred to Heather by a colleague who had several purchasing and selling experiences with her over the years. We were very fortunate and blessed to have Heather and her son, Brandon, by our side during our home purchasing experience. As young and inexperienced first-time home buyers, we had no idea what to expect in the rapid, crazy Lower Mainland condo market of 2018, where prices were going up by tens of thousands dollars per month! Heather’s expertise and insights were highly valuable. She helped us set realistic expectations and provided us with tips and guidance along the way. She taught us what to look for in the surroundings, buildings, and units, as well as what were the critical documents and contents to read. Heather did not push for a sale. She told us the truth, even when it was sometimes difficult to hear – whenever a nice-looking unit did not truly match our immediate or long-term needs, she let us know. She always put our interests first. On multiple occasions, Heather was late for family events because she really wanted to show us the condos so we didn’t miss the opportunity. Heather and Brandon’s honesty, integrity, and professionalism make them role models in their profession. The world needs a lot more real estate agents like Heather and Brandon! We highly recommend Heather. We know whom to call when family, friends, colleagues, or our future selves may need to buy or sell real estate.","21 November, 2018",Leah Young," Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

It was time to sell our family home of more than 40 years. While remaining on task, Heather was sensitive to the personal emotions and delicate situations that came with this job. We appreciate Heather's straight-forward approach. She provided us with her research of similar houses in the area and surrounding areas and stated up front what she felt a realistic listing price should be and the fees involved. We felt Heather was open and always made herself available when questions arose from each of the separate family members. She provided us with ongoing neighbourhood updates before, during and after the sale. In light of our situation, Heather explained to us what the standard procedure was and sought further expertise and legal advice for us and had documentation rewritten to suit our needs. In the end we were thrilled with the selling price, the speed at which the house sold and the manner in which Heather dealt with all the individuals involved. We would recommend anyone interested in selling a home to take the time to meet with Heather Mah.","20 November, 2018",The Seki Family," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

My experience in dealing with Heather has been mind changing. My past opinion of realtor's is that they are only out to get their commission. Not Heather. She treated our buying and selling if it was her own purchase. She was very detailed on her searching for the right property for us, was never pressuring us on any decisions, available to us at all times and much, much more. I think Heather goes over and beyond her duties as a realtor. Her biggest flaw is that she is too caring. Not saying that there isn't other realtors out there like Heather but they should all be like her.","19 November, 2018",Sandra Gillis," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather sold my mother's house after her passing. Throughout the process she was helpful and considerate; there was significant emotion involved. The advice she gave for preparing the house for sale was practical and informative. Her enthusiasm and hard work were really appreciated. She did not assume anything, she kept working until everything was completed. Her professionalism and honesty made working with Heather so easy. After more than a year to reflect on the sale I can honestly say Heather did a really good job. I have no hesitation in recommending Heather as a real estate agent.","16 November, 2018",Rosemary Kitching," Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada",4.89,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

We had to come to Canada from the UK this year to clear and sell our Aunt’s house; we had two weeks to get things into place, which was challenging to say the least. Heather Mah was recommended to us by a mutual professional person, as Heather was also acting for her. We contacted Heather during the second week, she came to see us the next day, and the house was for sale two days after we left to come back to the UK. Heather was from the very start a reliant professional who knew the local housing market, and acted with both integrity and sympathy regarding our immediate situation. Some of the things Heather provided for us: • An initial market Analysis package. • She gave good advice as to our proposed house price, and provided regular email alerts as to the other local properties for sale. • Advice on the presentation of the property for viewing. • Provided an Open House weekend, and gave feedback on the results. • Prompt replies to emails and phone queries, she phoned us, in the UK seven days a week. • Identified that we needed an old underground oil tank plus a large tree removed. These tasks were accomplished expertly by recommended first-rate tradesmen who quickly carried out the work. • Contacted local authorities and our Solicitor when necessary. To summarize Heather went extra miles and miles for us going beyond our expectations. We had an offer on the property, which was above our asking price three days after we listed and was very pleased when the house was sold. We would not hesitate to recommend Heather, and if she sold properties in the UK would be using her services here as well, (subtle hint Heather!)","16 November, 2018",Gail & Roger Simpson," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Without a doubt Heather Mah is the hardest working agent out there, her knowledge of the property market is second-to-none and we felt so reassured having her as our agent during every intimidating step of the home buying process. As first time buyers we were somewhat nervous about buying property but Heather's warmth and professionalism shone through at every step, and she broke down complex information for us that really helped make things clear. Her honest input and guidance about the process and which neighbourhoods to focus on was so appreciated and we ended up with a home that we truly love. Thank you, Heather, from the bottom of our hearts!","13 November, 2018",Fiona Mah," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Heather Mah. I listed my mother's home with Heather under less than desirable circumstances as she had passed away suddenly. Throughout all transaction and negotiations Heather has been professional, friendly, compassionate and supportive. Heather has offered advice when needed, kept me up to date with progress and guided me through the quick and efficient sale of my mother's house. Heather definitely made the whole experience go as smoothly as possible with the least amount of stress. She was very professional in her marketing strategy and successfully managed to get more than the listing price. I would have no hesitation in recommending Heather as an excellent real estate agent to anyone considering selling their home.","09 November, 2018",ugo lepore, Vancouver,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather Mah is a fantastic agent. She is very professional in all aspects of real estate. Being new in the real estate market she guided me through everything step by step and explained it all to me. On some of the matters I was given the pros and the cons for the situation and able to make up my mind then. Heather was very flexable with her time. She accommodated us with our meeting times since we worked different work shifts. She also was keeping us informed from a trip overseas. Her lines of communication were open any where and at any time. I was given updates on all situations as soon as they came up. I did not have email at the time and she had everything arranged in orderly fashion for me manually done. If you are buying or selling any type of real estate, Heather Mah is the realtor that you should be contacting to do her magic for you.","08 November, 2018",Goldie Martin," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",4.9,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Since moving into my first condo in 2012 to finding our dream townhouse in Vancouver in 2017 Heather has been there all the way! Without a doubt she is passionate about her job and dedicated to her clients. With such a fast-moving market Heather managed to research and organize all the information we needed to make an offer on a home and subsequently sell our place in a short time period which we initially didn’t think was possible. We were able to rest easy at night knowing we were in good hands. My husband and I were impressed with the quality of the brochures, photos, and videos that were done to sell our home. We appreciated her patience with our questions as well as prompt updates during the selling process. All of her hard work certainly paid off as we were thrilled with the outcome of the sale. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Heather to our closest family and friends. I think it’s rare to find someone in this industry who is so honest and committed to the job. We look forward to working with her in the future!","29 October, 2018",Charlene Copeland," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

To be able to work with a realtor so passionate and dedicated to their industry was an eye opener for me. As a first-time home buyer, I did not know much going into the process. I was quite nervous getting myself into the housing market and if you’re from the Lower Mainland, you’ll know it’s the hottest market in the city.
Heather was able to guide and educate me along each and every step of the way. If you’re a first-time home buyer like me, you’ll love her First-Time Home Buyer Guidebook. Her experience and expertise in the real estate industry is what truly helped me purchase the perfect condo. She went above and beyond, day in and day out, updating me, providing me her honest input and suggestions. Her guidance eased my nervousness and I trusted Heather 100% with one of the largest investments I will ever make in my life. For Heather, her clients needs always come first. And now that the purchase of my condo has been said and done, I can say that I am so proud to be a client of Heather Mah.
Without a doubt, I will use Heather Mah again as my realtor for my next housing purchase. Thank you again Heather!","17 October, 2018",Meghan Wong," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

My daughter and I worked with Heather to purchase our first condo together and really can’t say enough good things about her. She is knowledgeable, approachable, personable, endlessly patient, and incredibly generous with her time (including mornings, evenings, and weekends) She answered every question and explained every form and every part of the process clearly and thoroughly. Buying a condo in this market is challenging, but working with Heather made it as painless and straightforward as possible. We highly recommend her.","15 October, 2018",Evelyn Mah," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

I have worked with Heather couple years ago when I purchased my property. This time around she and Brandon helped me sold the property. Heather is the most hard working professional I have worked with. She brings wealth of knowledge, experience, and great attention to detail. I will not hesitate to work with her and Brandon again or recommend them to anyone who needs help buying or selling properties.","02 October, 2018",Yi Li, Burnaby,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah

Heather was an absolute delight to work with. She really took the time to get to know me as a person and understand my needs to live downtown. Her approach allowed me to see places that I initially wanted, as well as gave me a new perspective on areas that I didn’t even consider. This showed me a more complete view of Vancouver and I am very grateful for her advice. Throughout the process Heather kept in touch with me and sent me numerous listings. She would attend open houses and showings with my family and offer honest and helpful advice throughout the journey. I now live in the home of my dreams and it wouldn’t have been possible without her.","07 June, 2018",K.

I would like to thank Heather for helping through the purchase and sale of my first property. I was not very familiar with the real estate market and Heather has shared some invaluable knowledge that allowed me to take the right decisions. She was there every step of the way, answering my questions, providing advice and thanks to her it was a smooth and efficient process. Heather did a lot of research, open house visits, and was very invested in making sure I found the right house for me. She is not here just to make a sale but truly cares about her client’s satisfaction and will go above and beyond.
It is an absolute pleasure working with Heather; she is extremely professional, organized, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. She is definitely the BEST realtor in the city and I would highly recommend her to anyone navigating the crazy Vancouver real estate market!","18 September, 2017",JVB B," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah
