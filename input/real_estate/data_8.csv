Eva is a great agent. I was looking for an investment property and potential future residence. I was an out-of-town client and not familiar with the Greater Vancouver Area, Eva provided me with a number of excellent property choices for me (email, web) for me.. During my guided in-person site visit with her to my vetted potential purchases, Eva gave me a run down on the various pros and cons of each property, along with some not so obvious information such as neighborhood environment e.g. lower crime rate, renter area preferences, conveniences etc. Also she was very helpful during the actual purchase process (I was a newbie). Very happy with the results.","08 March, 2021",Jim Hui," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 14:56:30.454333,2021-06-17 14:56:33.302880,Eva Li

We are US citizens trying to sell our mother's property in Vancouver. We connected with Eva Li through a friend's referral. We contacted Eva only through the phone and text messages. Though we have never met Eva face to face, she provided us with excellent service. She thought of many details that we have not thought about. For example, when it is best to list the property, what is needed to be done to the property for optimal showing etc. Eva was very understanding as well. She understood that we needed someone to guide us to sell this foreign property without hesitation. She listed the property for us, and was able to sell this property within the week with a great offer as well. With us being in the US all this time, Eva did everything for us like it is her own property. We appreciate all the time and effort that Eva has spent with and for us, and we will definitely recommend her to anyone who wants to sell or buy a house.

To conclude, this has been the second time my Family Members and I appointing her to represent our interests. As expected, she is helpful and quickly respond to our requests.
My small disappointment was that I could not receive sufficient document copies from the Strata Management Company. That could be possibly due to the arrangements done by Realtor representing the Sellers.","07 May, 2019",Matthew Wong, Vancouver,4.71,2021-06-17 14:56:30.454333,2021-06-17 14:56:33.302880,Eva Li

We have been dealing with our realtor, Eva Li, since 1990. She helped us to sell our older home in Vancouver when our youngest child was just a month old; and then helped us to buy a newer house in a prime location. Later on, she also listed and sold my mother’s house at an excellent price, in Vancouver East. Furthermore, 6 years ago, when we were ready for an investment property, with the help of Eva’s good advice, we purchased a house in North Burnaby for rental. Eva is professional, kind, and always made us feel comfortable while we worked with her. She is very knowledgeable with the market conditions, and provided excellent service. Eva took care of all the details in our real estate needs during the selling and buying process. We would highly recommend Eva Li to all our friends and relatives!

We were selling our two-bedroom condominium in Burnaby, B.C, and were fortunate to retain Eva Li as our real estate agent. As we live in Edmonton, Alberta, the selling process was rather a complicated one for us, but Eva, after explaining to us all the relevant rules governing the transaction, led us safely through the intricacies of the sale. She is very experienced and always ready to help and her instructions and suggestions to us (via Internet and phone) were clear and helpful. We can recommend her services to anybody interested in sale and purchase of real estate properties in the Vancouver area.","30 September, 2016",Jiri and Dagmar Losert," Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada",4.84,2021-06-17 14:56:30.454333,2021-06-17 14:56:33.302880,Eva Li
