Mark quickly identified our preferences and helped us find the property we wanted. He advised on building quality, strata and insurance considerations, and did his due diligence whenever I sought his opinion.\n\nAfter finding the correct home, Mark's connections, experience, and professionalism helped us navigate and win a very competitive multiple offer situation. He closed the deal quickly and at the correct cost, beating out multiple other buyers while still providing exceptional value.\n\nMark goes above and beyond for his clients. I highly recommend Mark for anyone seeking a realtor in Vancouver and will definitely be using his services again in the future!",
