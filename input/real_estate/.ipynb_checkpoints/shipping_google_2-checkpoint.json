It’s funny cause I read reviews and the  all agree on two things: 1. Disrespectful staff, and 2. ANDREW, the owner, the worst of them all (see reviews here but especially on Yelp about him). What a terrible experience. They left information about fees out even when I asked from the beginning. Anyway, these people are not worth more than this minute it took to write this. 4.4 on 235 reviews is a lie. Their own employees wrote this. Go to Yelp and check there!!",

There was a strong paint smell in the room. I did not notice when a staff is checking me in because I was wearing a alcohol sprayed mask when meeting her. Then I left right away for work. After returning to the apartment after work, I found this place smells very toxic. The friend who helped me moving in had a feeling of nauseous. I had to move to my friend’s place because it was late night and I do not want to risk my health. Also, when we left, the shower curtain in the bathroom fell while my friend was pulling the entry door! The place is not at all safe for living! Then I reported the issue to Plan A but I was unexpectedly mistreated by them.\n\nThey denied there is any safety concerns in the space, claiming that the room was inspected and the smell is non-harmful. But once you are breathing in the room, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THEM. Also, they had a very aggressive attitude while negotiating. They questioned my intention of reporting, since I did not mention this issue when checking in. But by that time I was wearing a mask and could not smell. What I could do was to report as soon as I realized it, even if it’s after checking in. Plan A believed I just want to receive my refund by reporting. However, I PAID FiRST! If I do not want to spend money, why would I make a reservation at all? They kept saying they will try to dispute my case so that I do not get my refund, even telling me that my friend “unfortunately offered me a bad solution”. It was indeed personal attack.\n\nStay away from this company. They are sophisticated on dealing with legal issues and you will lose on debating with them even if you do have a reasonable statement. Airbnb processed my case for about 10 days but the result came out that I do not receive any refund. But still, I will not stay in their place for that I lost my trust on both this company and Airbnb.\n\nDo not trust the ratings. People or their employees are paid to write it.  They also turned off the rating on Airbnb platform, maybe because there are too many complaints.",

If you're comfortable with that, go ahead and rent from them!\n\nAppliances didn't work and they told us that was normal. Tried to up the rent by 15% after 6 months. Tried to make us pay for home repairs that were a result of poor construction (our front door lock breaking off, for example). Many, many other issues that Plan A told us were our fault and responsibility, which added a lot of stress and work to our lives despite paying a premium price. If you're ready to never be able to feel safe to relax in your own home, pay for everything a landlord should, and face rent increases every few months, then I definitely recommend Plan A.",

Although we mostly communicated throughout the transaction with his’s team, who manage day-to-day operations, he was present at the closing. He was very organized and efficient that was in stark contrast to the seller’s side. He conducted himself in an utmost professional manner and clearly explained the final steps in the process.

On the other hand, the building was poorly managed and the people working there had NO clue what other colleagues in the real state were doing. MISCOMMUNICATION. A week after moving in, someone called us to do the \"move in inspection\" when we were already living there. Weird. Also, when my brother moved into the other studio, it was filthy and they didn't do anything about it. On top of that, when you move out they charge you the cleaning fee which they say it might be around 50$ (it's 25$ per hour) Surprise, surprise, it's more like 150$ of your deposit. Some people are told that the amount taken will be according to the time invested in cleaning, but sometimes it's not the case. But if the place was that dirty, I guess the people who lived in that studio before him was charged an outrageous amount of money but they didn't clean the place.\nDuring our time renting through Plan A, they would inform us about an inspection or other things and they were NEVER on time. They were late or wouldn't show up at all. They are not reliable.",

Reported to Strata and building authorities.\n\n- Advertise fully stocked kitchens and do not provide basic kitchen supplies like knives, dish racks, pots etc. But have the audacity to yell at you on the phone shamelessly claiming they did.\n\n- Fundamental insect issues (drain flies & bed bugs) in multiple units (thorough documented evidence collected and reported to building and housing authorities).\n\n- Their reps have no sense of hospitality yet want to conduct business on Airbnb. Someone needs to inform them that Airbnb is not a leasing platform but a hosting platform. They openly drop F-bombs on calls with you and only respond when threatened to be reported. Their accounting rep even had the audacity to vocalize to me that she did us a favor by assisting us shift to another unit of theirs that we were forced to shift to because of their inability to maintain the plumbing hygiene of the one we were in or timely respond to our communications for assistance. Only at the threat of reporting did they come running scared.\n\n- They try to do showings of units while you are in them as Airbnb guests and do not provide any notice whatsoever. I had to send away 2 viewings in the mornings. That too during a time of Covid. They don't see humans. They see $.\n\n- After seeing (real) Google reviews about them along with (real) Yelp & Airbnb reviews, we consider ourselves lucky as we escaped without losing any money but did lose a lot of time, energy, and sense of security at their hands.\n\n- The megalomaniac heading this operation needs to be Googled for just 5 minutes for one to understand what kind of character he is and the \"company\" he is running.\n\nThat being said, the unit we Airbnb'd from them was very pretty but it's a shame that their lack of ability to maintain these pretty units is proving to be a harrowing experience for anyone that dares to live in them. Steer clear friends. Apartment leasing companies tend to have bad reputations but this one and their main man are a step ahead in that regard.\n\nWatch now as they respond with either \"Fake review, never dealt with this person\" or provide falsehoods to nullify the above. Sorry Plan A, we know your type and were sure to collect an overwhelming amount of evidence to match our claims. Go deal with your bed bugs, drain flies and pay up on the fines. We'll chat after. :)",

Few days later,  new tenants moved in the apartment next door, a plan a rental as well. These tenants were horrible, partying all night, smoking all kind of stuff. Once again, many complaints to the rental agency were met with disdain and mockery.\nAfter 4 weeks we were exhausted and decided to move out.  Off course we did not get our deposit back.\nIt seems from all the reviews that you can say good by to you deposit the moment you sign the rental lease with this company.  It sounds almost like a scam operation than a honest business.\nThe reviews on yelp seem to be more guanine than the fake ones they keep posting themselves.\nTo have an idea on how bad is this company reputation just google “greed eviction”.\nWe wish we did our research before giving our deposit to these unscrupulous people. .",

However after seeing all these fake 5 stars reviews poping up all a sudden, I feel it is my responsibility to alert other potentials renters about what they are embarking in when dealing with this company.\nNearing the term of my pregnancy, I wanted to have my mother coming from Sweden to be by my side. We decided to take a rental for her closer to our place, for 3 months. We found a place advertised by plan a real estate. During the showing, the place did not look at all as the pictures advertised. The furniture's looked old and very used, the whole place was smelling sigarettes and all sort of dirt on the floors. I was assured it will be all cleaned before my mother moves in. We signed a 3 months lease. The day my mother's arrived, she went traight to the place from the airport, I received a frantic call from her. I went to see what it was all about, the place was even dirtier than when I saw it the first time. I called plan a manager to have an explanation. I was told the place was cleaned. I took pictures and I went to their office to show them that it was not. As soon as we arrived, we were told if there is any complaint we have to talk to the owner, anoop. That what we did, we explained him the situation and showing him the pictures. His response was quite puzzling \"if you want a clean place go to a 5 stars hotel\". When insisting that we paid for a clean place, the F... words stared spuwing out of his mouth. My mother and I were in chock. During our entire life, in Sweden and here, we haven't been in a presence of such a vulgar, inscrupolous and shady individual.\nHe refused to give back neither the deposit not a portion of the first month rent and on top of that they charge us cleaning fees using our credit card they had on file. We just forfeited everything because we did not want to deal with this individual anymore. It was not worth complicating my pregnancy for.\nMy advice, stay away from this company, they will scam you for sure. And don't trust these fake stars reviews, they are all paid for or from his staff.",
