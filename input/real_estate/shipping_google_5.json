There were several occasions when I told him I was interested in a unit and he followed up by forwarding me very useful information on local developments in planning for that area. He was also very cool headed when helping me negotiate with sellers when the bidding got intensive, and was very diligent in the process even at odd hours of the day. The firm's website is also very usable, and has a very wide inventory. Overall the service is excellent and I will be recommending the Pospischil Realty Group to my friends and family in Vancouver!",

That moment brought up the belief that we could ship on with him about our journey of getting a dream home.

And, when we were informed as a new house owner, we felt Charley was truly happy from the bottom of his heart as well. Thank you so much Charley.

Part of this marketing included staging the property for us so that it could be shown off to its full potential.  The team at Pospischil Realty advertised the condo very aggressively, and their proactive marketing campaign ended up being extremely important.  In the week following the listing of the condo, 94 visitors came through yielding 14 interested parties and ultimately 3 competing offers.  The team negotiated over several hours resulting in the top offer being 80% above the list price and a record sale for the building in the prior period.  Trust Marty when he proposes a listing price.  We cannot imagine any other team doing any better for us in this property sale, and certainly not so quickly.",

The current market and what our expectations should look like.  Marty's WHOLE TEAM is exceptional, professional, and kind and was immediately at our side through the pre-sale staging, photos, measurements and everything that needed to be done.  The whole process took 20 days from our first meeting to the date of offer acceptance.  Our sale completed at almost 125% of our asking price, as a result of the exceptional extras and efforts that the team puts into full court marketing and ensuring that the public is aware of the sale. There is truly nothing more or different that I believe that this team could have provided throughout this process to improve upon our experience. Marty, Adam, Jennifer, Charley - THANK YOU!!! ~ 🙏🏻Vivienne, Tricia & Ian",

They really pulled out all the stops to get me the best price possible and they did it all from list to sale in just over a week with ten offers! They were great at reassuring me and helping me navigate the whole process. They have a marketing strategy for a reason and they know what they're doing.

Marty listened to my  concerns, requests and emails, with utmost professionalism. He answered all my emails promptly and kept me up to date with every step of the way. On the evening of the sale, Marty and son Adam were very patient when presenting the offers, and I felt comfortable as they made sure I understood every possible outcome. It was a big decision, and I relied heavily on their guidance, but never felt rushed. As an older person I would have liked more phone calls rather than emails, as I am not tied to my computer as perhaps the younger generation is. I didn't respond as quickly as I would have with a phone call. However the \"Back office\" feature was very good for keeping track of activity with my sale, and I could refer to it many times, as I became inundated with more activity and interest on my property.  They really took care of me, and for that I am grateful.",

As a first time buyer it was a relief to have such an experienced person leading us on what can be a scary journey.  And even now, two years after closing our sale, Team Pospischil continues to stay in touch which just shows they really care about their clients over the long run.\n\nI have recommended these guys to friends entering the market and have no reservations recommending them to anyone.  If you want an honest and hard-working realtor with YOUR best interests in mind then look to Team Pospischil.",

Through the process, I was impressed with Marty, Adam and David. So, when it was time for me to look for a west side home for ourselves, they were the obvious choice.\n\nDavid Wu was professional, knowledgeable, understanding, sincere, patient and helpful during our difficult search to find the right house at an attainable price for the big move from the suburbs. With a challenging seller, the negotiations quickly hit a snag and it looked like nothing would satisfy the seller, that’s when Marty and his team kicked it into high gear with a strategy meeting followed by negotiations that resulted in a win-win for us and the seller.  Marty further negotiated for favorable resolutions to get deficiencies repaired. Marty is an exceptional realtor and negotiator.\n\nThanks to Marty and his team, I’m finally moving back to the west side (and no more insane commutes) after 30 years!",

I felt like I could ask him anything and he would know the answer or find it for me. No leaky condos in my future!\n\nDavid Wu spearheaded my search and tirelessly met me for open houses and viewings. Finally when I found the perfect home (which not many first-time home buyers get to say); his real estate prowess really came out! I can say with 100% certainty that I was only able to have my offer accepted because of his smart and quick thinking, his analysis of the market and his offer strategy.\n\nGetting the phone call from David confirming my offer was accepted was the highlight of 2017; I couldn't have done it without them!\n\nIf you're a first-time home buyer, a 20th-time home buyer, or looking to sell your property, I would not hesitate to call Pospischil Realty Group!",

Pete spent a lot of time with us weighing up the pros and cons of the different areas in Vancouver and where we could see ourselves living as a family. We saw so many properties and Pete always made time for us to do this. He helped us navigate all the new things we had to learn as first time buyers. He always seemed to be able to make time for us despite his crazy work load! He was very well connected in the real estate industry in the city and gave us great recommendations for all the professionals you need to close the sale. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to anyone thinking of starting their search for a home in Vancouver.",

Other reviewers get it exactly right when they say he makes you feel like his only client—I have no idea how he does it, but his responses are incredibly speedy and he was always able to set up viewings on very short notice.\n\nOn top of his amazing service, Pete also has extensive knowledge of the Vancouver real estate market. He was able to advise on neighborhoods, build quality, strata considerations, etc., and very quickly picked up on our preferences and what we were looking for in a home. We had also only ever purchased property in Singapore, and he was very helpful and patient in guiding us through the process of buying a home in BC.\n\nWe must have seen dozens of listings during our search, but Pete was always happy to help schedule and join us for viewings and never appeared to tire of us. You can also count on Pete to be extremely detail-oriented and do all the required due diligence when you're ready to make an offer. We were in the process of preparing an offer on a place when Pete discovered that there was an upcoming hotel development close to the building which would significantly change the views and add years of upcoming construction.\n\nPete is very well-connected in the industry, and when we finally came across a home that checked all the boxes for us, his relationship with the seller's agent proved to be extremely helpful in closing the deal as quickly as possible (and $40k under asking!). He was also able to refer us to a great mortgage broker, property inspector, and real estate lawyer, which made the process of offering and closing a very smooth one.\n\nI definitely recommend choosing Pete as your realtor, and would engage his services again without hesitation in the future!",

      "text": "This is a long overdue review.  I was looking for an investment property in Fall 2019.  Having already bought / sold homes a few times over the last 2+ decades and thus have wide experience (good and bad) with different realtors, I tried to make this purchase on my own -- without a realtor.\n\nLong story short, in the end, I did work with a realtor.  I chose Pete Shpak and I am still grateful 1 year later for all his assistance and advice.  He's the best.\n\nPete is a great guy - incredibly hard working and professional.  You'll get that from reading all his other reviews.   What really stands out for me is that Pete is value-added. He gave me information I didn't have access to - and I'm pretty good at research and digging for information on my own.   Pete is a great listener.   He heard me out and understood exactly what I wanted. He didn't waste my time. He knows what he is doing.  He has opinions and will let you know what he thinks - but he doesn't force his views on you.    He's also a brilliant negotiator.  You can't go wrong.\n\nTwo more reasons why Pete exceeds expectations and stands out from other realtors:  (1) Pete understands the market;  and (2) Pete knows his data.  Pete was the first realtor in Vancouver who offered \"previously sold\" prices on the internet before other realtors started doing it.  While assessed values of properties are available to everyone, only realtors had previously sold prices.  I was digging deep on google for data on my own and was able to access Pete's data even before I met him!!  It was only a coincidence we ended up speaking on the phone.\n\nDuring my search, Pete steered me towards a newer / popular building with a great reputation.  It was very nice - but I found the unit small and expensive for price per square footage.  I had wanted a larger footprint for that price.  Nevertheless, I ended up buying the newer / smaller unit in January 2020 and inherited the tenant that came with the unit.\n\nFast forward to end of August 2020 - my tenant advised she had to leave.  Given the global pandemic (and landlords in the West End and Downtown were offering first & last months rent for free over summer 2020) I was prepared to have the investment unit sit empty.  Boy - was I wrong.  I had a dozen queries in the first 8 hours of posting and almost 40 interested renters over 2 days.  Received 2 applications within the first 48 hours.  There was a HUGE demand and I had NO IDEA.  I found a wonderful new tenant within days after checking her references.\n\nPete told me the building had a great reputation and was a solid investment for me.  He was totally right!  I'm not worried about having to rent that place out again if my current tenant decides to leave.\n\nI could go on about what a great, hard-working guy Pete is -  but I'm sure his clients have got that covered in all the other reviews.   Life has been busy and we've all had our issues to deal with - but now that 2020 is finally over, it will be nice to move on from last year.  Pete was one of the silver linings from 2020 - someone I met and who brought value and good advice and someone I would be delighted to work with again should I have the opportunity to do so in the future.     Thanks so much Pete!",

The real estate market can be intimidating and at times over whelming, but Pete is a true professional who guided us through the process of selling our condo and purchasing our first house with ease and confidence. Pete helped us navigate putting an offer on a house before we listed our condo, which can be very unnerving. But he explained everything very clearly, at times explaining it more than once and made sure we were comfortable with each step. He also provided an excellent service to us by promptly having our condo professionally cleaned, photographed, videoed and measured. He followed that up with excellent marketing and after less than 2 weeks of making an offer on a new home we had sold our condo above asking price, and then moved 30 days later. During this whirlwind Pete was available at anytime via phone, email, text and he made numerous trips out to meet with us to discuss everything in great detail. Although we were not his only clients during this time, we felt like we were his first priority and he was on top each and every detail involved in the quick purchase and sale. Pete is very approachable, personable and extremely knowledgeable. He is the type of guy you want to be friends with and have over for dinner in your new home! We would highly recommend his superior realty services to both the first time home buyer and the seasoned home purchaser.",

Over a beer, he taught us about the buying process, and on our first tour, he helped us discover what was truly important to us in a home.  It was clear to us that Pete was in it for the relationship, not just a quick sale - it was important to him to find us the right place.  Pete is patient and a great listener, and he made it easy for us to ask him any and all questions that we had.  He knew the answer to just about everything, and we appreciated that he also took the time to teach us along the way.  When it came time to put forward an offer, he provided valuable advice on how to best position ourselves for success.  Once our offer was accepted, Pete continued to support us through his great network of people.  He was able to connect us with experts in each field, from lawyers to house inspectors to interior decorators.  Throughout the whole process Pete was flexible and accommodating – he would meet us when and where was most convenient for us, even after hours at our offices if need be.  To top it all off Pete made our search relaxed and fun, we really looked forward to each time we got to meet with him to see something new.  At the end of the day, we are in a home we love, and we won’t hesitate to recommend Pete to everyone we know.",

After meeting Pete and going on our first ’home tour’, we knew we were very lucky to have him on our side. His knowledge of everything home related was exceptional. He had an answer to every question we asked - and often brought up important points that we never would have thought of. There are many traits that set Pete apart, but one really stands out: he cares. He was always honest with us, and he struck a perfect balance between listening and being responsive to our feedback while also speaking up based on his impeccable intuition. He was not afraid to tell us when he didn’t think the fit was right.\n\nOnce it was time to make an offer, he had us prepared in every possible way; it gave us the edge in a highly competitive situation. We now have a home that was beyond our highest expectations (and at a price that was below what we had budgeted for). All thanks to Pete. I’m gushing a bit in this review but I’ll also throw in that he is just a great guy who is fun to be around. You will absolutely not regret working with Pete!",

I was completely inexperienced in the field of real estate and Pete provided professionalism, respect, patience and expertise to help me make the decisions which were in my best interest. In the end, I got the perfect place at a great price and never really stressed at all about the specifics.\n\nWhile looking for the perfect place, Pete was extremely patient and creative in showing me different properties. Despite how many times I said that I didn't like a place, Pete never showed even a frown. He always maintained his positive persistence that eventually, when the time and place were right, we would find the perfect place. And, we did!\n\nWhat I appreciate most about Pete is that he was always very professional, but most of all trustworthy. He has experience with a wonderful team of lawyers, inspectors, insurance agents and everyone whose services we enlisted, based solely on Pete's recommendation, were excellent.\n\nI'll just re-emphasize that I knew nothing about doing anything of the things we did and I actually can't believe that it all happened so easily.\n\nThank you Pete!",

As this was our first purchase we were unsure about and overwhelmed by the real estate market and purchasing process. Pete made us feel comfortable from the first moment we met him and throughout the entire way. He explained the process clearly, provided his insights on the market and the developer of our apartment, and how to approach the negotiation. Between the 20 months we purchased and took possession of the apartment, Pete stayed in constant communication with us and checked in periodically, which showed his commitment and care.\n\nWe couldn’t have asked for a better realtor than Pete – we highly recommend him!",

He facilitated every step of the way, explained every single detail that seemed most confusing to me, and has such an amazing team that he works with.  From his awesome mortgage broker, to talented photographer and easy to deal with lawyer.  Every single step of the way of what seemed like the most intimidating process, was so easy with Pete.

We really enjoyed being ‘taught’ rather than ‘told’ and this gave us confidence that we were making an informed decision when we decided to buy.\nIf you are looking for property in the Vancouver area, Pete is your man. Whether you jump on an opportunity that you can’t refuse, like us or play the long game, Pete will help you through every step of the way until you find the property that checks all the boxes.\nMuch appreciated Pete!",

We don’t have a single negative thing to say about him and tons of positive.\n\nProfessionalism: He is as professional as it gets. Punctual and always prepared. He took us for tours and had all showings ready to go, prepped and knowledgeable about properties and areas. He wasn’t just  trying to make a quick sale, and you can tell by how much time and effort he put into us as clients.\nExperience: Real estate is what he does. This is not just some side hustle. This is his craft and it shows from his experience with the market.\nFriendliness: He is genuinely a good person and always friendly.\nHonesty: Always real and honest with all his advice and tips. Never made recommendations based on the sale price, but based on actual honest opinion...and again, this was evident.\n\nWe had a great experience with Pete with our purchase. He really made the buy of our home very easy; always there for advice, always answering our million questions at different hours of the day! Also, Pete is a well-known realtor in the city, but he always managed to make sure we felt just as important as his other clients, which is very appreciated and not over-looked! :)\n\nPete, we can't say enough about you. Consider us life-long clients. :)",

Pete was upfront and honest, always giving us different choices and solutions for every decision along the way – without the feeling of being pressured one way or the other. Throughout the process, we were amazed with Pete’s excellent communication – there were never any mixed messages, and everything was clearly conveyed. He was confidently able to address all our questions, was very knowledgeable, and had a contact person for every profession we needed, which made both the buy and sell procedure feel effortless. His dedication made us feel like we were his only clients, when we know he was juggling multiple clients – Pete’s time management is much to be envied! Pete demonstrates the perfect balance between professional diligence and easygoing flexibility. And we have to also mention how thoughtful Pete is, as he would frequently ask how our elderly dog was doing throughout the stress of the move. He has certainly raised the bar on the standards of realtors and we would confidently recommend Pete to anyone looking for a realtor.",

Throughout the process, Pete provided informed and thoughtful advice and genuinely had my best interest in mind. I ended up purchasing an apartment that I absolutely love and am enjoying sitting back and watching how great of an investment it was.

His expertise in the market, his ability to guide us through the decision process and advise as a well-versed savvy real estate professional was second to none. With Pete, we sold our condo within 6 days of hitting the market and (after 300+ ppl viewed the property through two showings and a number of private appointments) after reviewing six competing offers I'm confident we received top dollar in record timing with minimal carrying costs. If you're looking to work with a true real estate professional, dial Pete.\nShaun and Kate Richmond",

We were \"pitched\" by nearly every realtor we met, and were completely unimpressed by most and not very motivated by others.  After going to see one of Pete's listings, he asked if we wanted to go for a drink and talk about his services. A few drinks later, Pete had an idea of what we were looking for and we had our first date lined up for Saturday afternoon to look at a long list of possible new homes. We were immediately impressed with Pete's knowledge of the market and individual buildings in our desired neighbourhoods, not only the ones we were going to see, but every building we asked about on the way as well. Pete kept the whole process low pressure, from our timeline, our relationship with him, and all of our purchasing decisions. He encouraged us to view a wide variety of types of buildings, outside of our Yaletown bubble, to gain a better understanding of what was out there and what we truly wanted. He took the time to bring us to wood frame walkups, townhouses in False Creek, new builds, presales and everything in between. Even though we ended up right across the street from our previous place, the process Pete took us through really helped us realize what was important to us all along (neighbourhood) and things we hadn't yet realized we couldn't live without (AC). We found our new home on that first Saturday, but Pete was patient with us as we looked around for a couple more weeks. Once we made our decision Pete helped us through the entire process, easing our fears and giving tips all along the way and negotiated a great price. He stuck with us through the inspection and walkthrough and we even went out to dinner to celebrate the day we moved in. Pete wowed us with his generosity and knowledge and we couldn't have done it without him.",

When we finally settled on our home at Meccanica he was involved every step of the way without being overbearing in the least.\n\nNot only did he help us find the right place for us he was there supporting us on the various walk throughs, understanding strata rules, etc. well after he had completed his part of the sale...honestly just about any question we had he was willing to find the answer including helping us secure a very tight window for move in.\n\nI have bought and sold numerous homes over many years and I can honestly say Pete has been one of the best realtors I've dealt with.  I'm so impressed I have no issue having Pete represent our company when we have employees considering a move to Vancouver.\n\nHe stands above the rest!",

There were a few complexities in our buying process, and Mike was accommodating in this regard, being able to re-evaluate and re-start on short notice. I should also mention that Mike's assistant, Amy, is amazing. She was quickly able to generate efficient itineraries for showings, which was highly appreciated in light of our difficult schedule.

I think Mike was knowledgeable about the market and helped me along the way with each transaction.  Buying a condo on my own was a challenge but Mike was there for me answering questions, checking out properties with me, getting the strata minutes to me quickly and helping me with all the paperwork and details.  His team was helpful as I do not own a car.  They picked me up and drove me around when I needed to deliver cheques on a timely basis. I feel quite happy about  my experience with Mike and his team and would use them again; although I hope I don't have to.",

However, he took a nasty turn when he decided to engage in a diatribe against the Chinese government as an argument for why he believed the real estate market in Vancouver would rebound. He made extremely ignorant, rude and aggressive comments on subjects he not only is not qualified to talk about, but which were entirely out of place at such a forum. He portrayed himself as a mercenary who relishes in the prospect of misfortune (conflict in Hong Kong) for achieving his own economic gain of having increased buyers in Vancouver's real estate. Both in an business and personal context, I would not want to associate with this individual.",

I have known Mike for a lot longer than I’ve been a realtor.\n\nI’ve read about Mike in the news lately. I think what is being lost is why he did what he did. Was it the right thing to do…maybe not, but he was trying to help his clients and that’s why he has been successful as a realtor. There is nothing illegal about what Mike did, it just doesn’t sit right with some. The way the government rammed this tax through also doesn’t sit right.  This government has been doing nothing for a very long time, and finally felt enough heat, close enough to re-election time, that they decided to take some action…way too late to make any difference for Vancouverites. Change the rules and have them take effect quickly, that’s not really a problem, but penalizing people who bought without these rules is not right. Trust me, I think there should have been way more regulations on foreign buyers, a long time ago. Mike would probably agree with me, because, despite what lots of people have been saying, he’s a decent ethical guy who does not like it that home ownership in Vancouver is out of reach for many. We both have kids, and have talked about it in that context.\nHow about complaining that the Feds and the Quebec government are letting immigrant investors enter through Quebec and come to Vancouver. What’s the point of closing that program everywhere in Canada except for Quebec. How about the banks, facilitating movement of money from China, that they know is illegal. As for affordability, the City of Vancouver is not as innocent as the Mayor would have you believe either. Ridiculous wait times for permits, high cost to developers…these are things that get passed on to homebuyers, not to mention significant increases to the property tax base when a development is occupied….more of a money grab.\n\nI’ve known Mike for years, and always found him to be knowledgeable, prompt with information, honest and straightforward. He is a professional, ethical, and very hard working guy. He’s also a good decent guy, and I don’t buy any of the ‘caring only about his wallet” or that he doesn’t care about Vancouver or affordability business, either.\n\nThe Media puts out flashy headlines, and benefits when those reading them don’t bother to dig into the issues any deeper. Dig a little!",

Mike was cc’ed on these emails and never noticed the issue or voiced concern when we didn’t show up for the walkthrough. When I found out about the missed walkthrough through my lawyer, I asked Mike over email to help me resolve this issue by getting another walkthrough scheduled. He called me to talk to me about the situation and told me he would follow up with the developer and would get back to me. He never contacted me again. I worked with the developer directly and had another walkthrough scheduled. The deal closed, I moved into my new place, and I still have never heard back from him nor have I received any congratulations from him—even though he has received payment from the developer for being my realtor. I am disappointed in his handling of this situation, and his support as my realtor overall. When I go to sell my property I will be looking for a different realtor to represent me.",

All I can see is that he was doing his job in trying to protect his clients' interests, believing that his foreign clients whom already signed contracts were treated unfairly. If the government proposed laws that would harm us BC residents, he would've worked just as hard to find solutions for us.",

His knowledge, guidance, and professionalism helped put me at ease as we began exploring options. His advice and recommendations were invaluable and his communication throughout the process was exceptional. Adam went above and beyond to help secure the deal. I was referred to Adam by a friend and I'm thrilled they passed along his information. I will be doing the same with my friends and family! Thanks again, Adam!",

Even more crucially, he's able to react to dynamic market conditions and recommend different approaches when buying/selling. From buying our new home to selling our existing one, he had us set in 2 weeks with all the closing and completion dates lined up perfectly, and didn't break a sweat. Thanks Adam!",

Jenna also was  very on point with all the small details and things i should know with certain areas and houses , plus she was very helpful with the contract details . When i was selling my house in the city i had a couple offers fall thru while i was on a time crunch to get my squamish house , Jenna and my other realtor cordinated the dates and other details that kept changing so it made the purchase side of things go so super smooth and as stress free as it could be for myself .\n\nI highly reccomend Jenna if your looking for a realtor in squamish , wether your a first time buyer/ seller or someone who has been through the buying and selling process before you wont be disappointed  . Even after moving here if i need help finding a company or person to do things she seems to have a recommendation for what ever you need!",

When you're in a market like this, where real estate is very sought after, and you often have competing offers, you want to be working with a realtor who knows what they are doing.\n\nOurs was not an easy purchase, with tight timelines, offers falling through on the place we were selling, and back up offers on the place we were buying; Jenna pulled all the stops to make sure we would be able to close the deal on our dream home.\n\nJenna is well researched and knows the space of real estate well. I would highly recommend working with her if you are in the market of selling or buying your home.",

We can say with all sincerity that he is caring, concerned, compassionate, detail conscious and responsive. His salient character component is his straightforwardness. Les is a \"straight shooter\"--he, as they say, \"walks the talk\" and provides his clients expectations which become their experiences. His success in the real estate business is due, no doubt, to this character trait. Nowadays, the three words which, unfortunately, have us baffled, deception, duplicity and dissembling, are not in Les' vocabulary. You know you have the right guy when you ask yourself:\n\"Would you buy a used car from Les Twarog?\" The answer is, unequivocally, yes.",

I called Les and Stephanie and told them that I was interested in buying a apartment in a certain building but there were no apartments for sale (yet) in the building I was interested in. Les and Stephanie took it upon themselves to write out flyers along with the price we discussed and flyered the apartments in the building I was interested in and low and behold an apartment owner did want to sell their apartment. Les and Stephanie took care Of the whole entire transaction. They made the process go extremely easy and stress free. They are both very professional and know exactly what they are doing. Since then I have hired them for a few more deals and with out a doubt they have surpassed my expectations. I love doing business with them both and would never turn to another real estate agent again.",

He not only tolerated our stupid questions but educated us and opened our eyes to what we are supposed to know as buyers. The sheer amount of information we received from Les and the team along with the immediate service was above our expectations, by far. Sad truth? When we bought our condo, we knew more about the history of the building than our strata board members. Yikes!",

However it was now time to sell so I contacted Paul and eight days later I accepted an offer. Working with Paul was a stress-free experience. I had multiple ways to contact him from my home in the Okanogan and felt that I could do this at any point whether I had a big question or just needed  a little reassurance. He was always there and very receptive. Paul  was totally professional and really knows the housing market. I put my faith in him and it paid off. I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone who is looking to sell a property in the Vancouver area. Thank you,  Paul.",

In selling our place, he told us exactly how things were going to play out, how many offers we could expect, and what our home could go for. He was exactly right, and his pulse on the market is undeniable. His whole team supported us through the entire process!\n\nWe felt that Haydn and Paul really got what we were after in our new home search, and understood our desire for a heritage home with a great layout in a walkable neighbourhood. They took us to several houses, and spent a lot of time with us. Obviously buying in the Vancouver market is extremely stressful, and even when our emotions got the best of us, Haydn and Paul were calm and steady, telling us we would end up with a beautiful home, which we did! We were in a multiple offer situation, and we were still able to win without reaching our max budget.\n\nThe entire process, we truly felt that Haydn and Paul were excited for us, wanted a nice house for us as badly as we did, and told us when to run away from places. We put 100% trust in them, and they did not let us down.",

I was quite new to the experience, Sal was very patient with me and he took the time to explain everything and advise me for the right purchase. He's very knowledgable and he doesn't give up until he helps you find what you are looking for. It took me 7 months to find what I was looking for, and Sal stayed patient with me and helped me throughout the way. Sal and his team are very professional and friendly. It feels nice to trust someone like Sal, it will make the whole real estate experience much more smooth. I definitely recommend Sal and his team! Thank you Sal!",

He treats you like a real friend and he truly cares. One of my properties was occupied by tenants who were very unhappy to learn the fact that I am selling! Sal was so tactful and strategic to handle the situation like a real professional. He ended up selling the property to a buyer he found through his own connections, so we didn’t even have to list it - almost $50,000 over my expectations.\n\nAnd then the stress level was so high cause I had already bought a new house and was under so much pressure to sell for a certain number! Sal is an amazing negotiator and he was able to not only create multiple offers, but also fought for us to the every last penny, and we really appreciate it. Highly recommend.",

We had a billion questions and were super cautious at various stages and Sal was always really responsive, patient and professional in his answers.  He also was honest about pointing out things he liked/didn't like in various properties we checked out and he helped us wait until we found a great fit before making an offer.  And then he did an amazing job of negotiating (...and helping us not panic during the process, haha.)  I'd absolutely recommend him to anyone & am amazed what a positive experience it was to work with him.

They were not only great at negotiating when buying our new house, but they also went above and beyond in preparing our house before putting it up for sale. They did a thorough market analysis in the surrounding neighbourhood of previously sold and active listings to provide us with a realistic listing price. They sold our house within the first week, subject free and with our desired completion and possession dates! They are fun and friendly to work with and take their job extremely seriously. Sal himself pays attention to the minute details that many would overlook, which is commendable. Rod is very observant and has a patient and calming personality, which is truly helpful when the stress hormones spike during the process. We are extremely happy with and thankful for working with Sal and Rod for selling our previous house and buying our new dream house.",

Sal and Rod took over our listing and they soon became our friends! They staged our home, painted it, took fresh photos and even made a promotional video for us! And they sold our home for almost full asking price in only a few weeks.\n\nThen the new challenge started!

The Sal Toosi Real Estate Team stood out as the best Vancouver has to offer: their rankings are excellent, their social media presence was strong, and I could tell they put a lot of work into their listings.\nWe spoke with Sal and then met with him at our home. He spent hours answering our questions, providing objective data regarding how many homes they sell, how long their listings typically stay on the market, and providing tons of info on comps in the area. Sal made the process incredibly easy and took extra steps many other Realtors don't (but should), like having a pro come and give us painting, staging, having professional photographs taken, and a lot more.\nWhen we saw our listing we were blown away. His hard work and knowledge of what it takes to sell a home really paid off - our listing looked amazing and knocked out the competition. The first buyer that saw the property put in an offer 100 K over asking price. Our townhouse went under contract 1 day after we put it on the market. We accepted and Sal walked us through every step of the closing process. It couldn't have been a more pleasant experience.\nI've recommended the Sal Toosi Real Estate Team to everyone I know. He's a true professional and a genuinely nice guy. I realize it won't always be this easy to sell your home, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better Realtor.",

He literally took my decluttering items himself in his own car and stored them at his house.  He added decorative items to stage my place, took photos and videos within a week.  We listed on Friday and had negotiated a full ask offer by Tuesday!  He is moving my items back to my house, he is organizing to have the holes in our walls patched up, he offers travel vouchers so that you can get out of town for the first open house, he made social media videos to showcase our home, literally I can't speak highly enough of his customer care... he even sent me a video of where people touched items in my condo and showed me that he personally sanitized the areas after the viewing to put my mind at ease.  I highly recommend Sal.  To be honest, a lot of people think that anyone can list their place in this hot market in Vancouver... but if you want to get every penny and you want to have someone that is smart, that will anticipate your needs, charming, always well dressed and always aiming to exceed your expectations... that's Sal.

He is the guy you want to spend time with.\nWe talked hours and hours on the options. When we chose a place he took over a week to go over all the building minutes, line by line. To make sure he sent all the documents to a third party professional company to double check. He sat with the owners agent several times to negotiate the deal. Usually the realtors send written offers and done. But he took the initiative and talked to them in person not once but several times. He himself insisted on the inspection of the condo and paid the fees out if his pocket. When we wanted to move in, he booked cleaning and moving teams for us and also covered all the expenses. The final shot came after we moved in, he came to our place with a gift. Omg am I in the heaven? N\nI worked with two realtors previously.\nBut this guy treated me like his own brother.\nThank you Sal toosi for being such an amazing soul.🙏🙏🙏",

I was a first homebuyer and had multiple questions and doubts, but Sal was patient through this process and he showed me the different options and explained everything thoroughly. You can trust Sal’s negotiation skills. I had a wise purchase within my budget because of Sal’s follow-up, his excellent negotiation skills and the tips he provided to me.\n\nI also appreciate Farzad's help on mortgage approval. Farzad works in Sal's team and he is a very professional, dedicated Mortgage Broker. Since I didn't have enough knowledge about mortgage, Farzad was so patient and he explained everything to me in details. He never left my questions without answer even I reached out to him during the weekend or evenings after working hours. He worked hard that I could get the best mortgage rate from the bank.\n\nI had a short experience with Sal's colleague, Mehrdad (Rod). But, during that short time, Rod showed me some homes in different neighbourhoods that I could gain a better perspective of what I want. One day,  I left a document at home while I was at work and we were supposed to send the document right away to the seller. Rod went above and beyond and helped me to send the document on time. Rod is really professional and helpful.\n\nI would like to say many thanks to Sal and his team. I wish them great success in all coming projects.",

During the open houses the itinerary was set with good spacing between viewings. They were also able to act on the houses we wanted to bid on quickly. When we did the house inspection Ron even went with the inspector himself and did a video call with us to do the live inspection (as we didn't have time to go to the place ourselves). We are so happy to get our new house with Ron and Teams help. They made the buying process pleasant.",

We were so fortunate that Ron accepted to take on this challenge at the beginning of January when the market did not seem particularly favourable but what an experience! Ron went above and beyond our expectations by taking charge of two upgrade projects and overseeing professional cleaning and impressive staging so that everything would be ready for market on February 1. His hard work relieved us of all the pressure of having to do this ourselves, especially since we live half an hour away. He communicated with us continuously, remained positive and supportive throughout the process, and attended to every detail. From February 1-9 Ron and his two colleagues, Jordan and Angela, hosted an amazing 70+ showings. His efforts were so successful that our condo sold in just 8 days at a record setting price!  We would highly recommend Ron to a friend, relative or anyone who is looking for a realtor who is highly competent, delightful to work with, trustworthy, and professional in every respect.  It is not surprising that he is ranked one of the best in the city. Thank you, Ron!",

They will contact realtors directly before your property even gets listed and this will create more demand for your property when it gets listed. Just have a look at his video testimonials. Not to mention he specializes in selling houses and really understands the market and strategy to get your house sold for a fair price in a reasonable time frame. If your Vancouver/Burnaby house has asbestos, mold, oil tank, structural concerns, old wiring, etc Ron will be able to find you a reputable specialist who can help remediate for a fair price. Also he has a background in rental properties so it’s very valuable because either you are an investor and need someone to know the rental market in depth and/or you have prospective buyers coming to look at your  house and will have questions about the rental market specifically and demographics for the neighborhood. I’m a Seattle agent and I know first hand how important it is to have the right agent on your side. Ron dominates the Vancouver market!",

In late August, 2018, we decided to choose\nRon Parpara to help us with the sale of my house.\n\nThe house was put on the market in early September and was finally\nsuccessfully sold in April, 2019 after multiple offers.  The first offer in\nOctober looked promising but the buyer pulled out because of financing\nissues.  Many low ball offers followed which didn't amount to anything\nsuitable.  The final offer which came in February and revised in April, hit\nthe jackpot with me and the buyers.\n\nAfter the completion date in July, Ron Parpara arranged a celebratory lunch for my husband and me, the buyers, as well as himself and the buyers' realtor.  It was so good to meet the nice people that bought my house.  My husband and I are very happy and so are the buyers with their property.  I know that they will take good care of the place.\n\nMy husband and I are definitely pleased and very satisfied with the job that Mr. Parpara did to get my house sold.  We will be hiring him again to assist us in buying a house in the Fraser Valley.\n\nRon Parpara has a very pleasant personality and demeanor.  Since I cannot text, he was willing to communicate in person, by phone, or through email.\n\nHe was always patient, kind, thoughtful, and willing to go the extra miles\nto meet my personal needs and preferences.  Even when he was busy, Mr.\nParpara never made me feel ignored or unimportant.  He would return all\nphone calls and emails in a timely manner.  He made extra phone calls to\nfind out certain information on my behalf.  He referred me and my husband to a real estate lawyer, oil tank company, a handy man and pest control company when necessary.\n\nMr. Parpara met us at our home, at the house in Burnaby, at lawyers' offices and wherever we needed him to.  He never lost patience when he had to take the extra time to explain any documentation.  Until I got comfortable with signing documentation over the computer, Ron was willing to meet us so I could sign actual paper work which took some effort on my part.\n\nRon Parpara is a very honest, ethical, dedicated and professional realtor. My husband and I sincerely recommend him to anyone who is looking for a highly skilled negotiator who does a very thorough and detailed job.\n\nAudrey M",

He did a pretty good job.\n\nWe had a good discussion at the very beginning about what exactly I was looking for in the right unit. He tried to put himself in my shoes to understand what my expectations were. He also asked me an interesting question – what my backup plan would be if prices surged beyond my budget. It wasn’t something I had thoroughly thought over so it was prudent for him to bring that up for me to think about.\n\nThen came the search. Ron has developed a fairly good knowledge of the downtown stratas over the years with his sales and property management experience. It did take a while to find good units though, due to the lack of inventory. We were outbid a couple of times, and simply too slow in some other instances. Eventually, we found a decent unit, quickly scheduled a showing, and prepared to submit an offer.\n\nRon was then able to put his negotiation skills to work. Our offer was met with a counteroffer with a higher price. I was ready, able, and willing to meet the seller with a price in the middle. However, Ron told me to be firm on my original price, and to let him continue negotiating. I reluctantly agreed, thinking it wouldn’t work, but I was wrong! Accepted offer!\n\nWe had a four-day subject removal period so Ron kicked it into high gear. He pointed some things out in the strata documents. Also, the unit happened to be already tenanted, but Ron drew on his property management experience to make sure there were no issues. Subjects were removed, and Ron continued working to ensure a smooth transition right through to the closing date.",

As a first-time buyer, I was entering this process as a complete newbie, along with a short deadline. Given all that, Ron took the time to walk me through the whole process, and showed me many properties to get a good feel for what I liked & did not like, rather than just rush a quick sale.\n\nOnce we found something that worked well, rather than settle for the seller’s first ‘best & final’, which I would’ve taken given the circumstances, he encouraged to play it slow through multiple expired offers over a few weeks, and in the end managed to negotiate the sellers down quite a bit from list (and well under budget). After that, his high degree of thoroughness clearly showed, as he repeatedly chased down both the seller’s agent & strata for updated documents, and helped me go through every key document. He also researched just about everything else you can think of – he looked up the developer’s history, recent & pending developments in the nearby area, past & potential issues with city & more. Further, he has a very good network of high-quality real estate professionals (lawyers, inspections, brokers) & tradesmen, many of whom I leveraged during my purchase. By the time we removed subjects, I was very confident with the purchase, as Ron goes through pretty much everything in detail.\n\nEven after the deal closed, Ron was still checking in & assisting. He helped set up the move, lined up additional professional cleaning & a locksmith, and offered to advise long-term on any sort of problem with the purchase or help lining up the right people for repairs or improvements.  There was also a residual issue with a fireplace, which Ron quickly resolved with the seller’s agent & arranged a prompt inspection to remove all worry.\n\nI quickly learnt throughout this process that it is quite easy to make costly mistakes. You need someone on your side like Ron who will fight for best price, ensure the due diligence is done to the highest degree, and make sure you are comfortable with what you purchase. Ron is very thorough & details-oriented - he is willing to go through just about everything, will go through pros/cons on all properties, and we even spent a good few hours just walking through the first purchase contract (which I highly recommend). He helped out immensely on all the various bumps along the way, and, even prepared me for potential issues & expenses over the next five years, as well as considerations upon resale. I have already recommended Ron to a couple other friends (they will be in good hands), and I definitely plan to come back when the time comes to sell, where his experience, hard work & meticulousness will be ever more important.",

From the get go, he never was pushy. He gave us all the information we needed to make an informed decision. He provided us a lot of helpful tips as first time home buyers. We were looking to buy in the East Vancouver area, and he was very familiar with the area. He was great at following up with us through the entire process, and even afterwards! We never had to chase time down. He also recommended lots of other great professionals for other parts of the buying process (like home inspectors, reno guys, etc.). We ultimately bought in the River District, after Ron took all our preferences into consideration and gave us some suggestions of places to look. He was very detailed-oriented through the entire process, and pointed out important things for us to consider. He even gave us a list of pros and cons of the property we were looking at!  Even though we were willing to go higher, he negotiated the price further down for us. There were so many little things he did that went above and beyond what typical realtors did. For example, when we moved in, the previous occupants left a large shelf and the place wasn't completely cleaned. He arranged for all those things to be taken care of, and he covered the costs. Even after we moved in, Ron has kept in touch and checking in to see how we are settling in. I cannot recommend him enough. I definitely will be suggesting Ron to people we know!",

He sold our west end condo and got a great price, very close to list price, in a cool market.  His competent and attentive sales service left my husband and myself free of the stresses normally associated with selling a home.\n\nRon coordinated junk removal, hiring a handyman/painter, and apartment/carpet cleaning.  He paid for these services from his own incentive program.  Also he handled all strata related issues like fire inspection and duct cleaning to avoid any additional fines.\n\nWe enjoyed Ron's knowledgeable, trustworthy, and patient style.  We would certainly employ him again as our realtor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKaija Oliver and Alfredo Coccimiglio",

He provides objective statistics while giving detailed feedback after each showing and thoroughly takes you through the step by step of the selling process.\n\nOnce you hand over the key to him, you do not have to worry about anything else. Expect him to respond quickly and do personal phone calls or meet in person if that’s preferred whether you are discussing an offer, feedback or any other property detail and believe me there are so many things that come up before, during and after.\n\nHe's also the one person you want representing you when buying, not just when selling. Smooth transactions and peace of mind is what he brings to the table. Having one high performing agent (so there’s no miscommunications along the way) is the best way to go by far. It's so much simpler and there's less risk for misinformation. I also really like that he won’t take on more clients than he can handle.",

From beginning to end, Ron was available 24/7 and was very proactive in finding me listings to view. Within 3 months I had found the perfect place and with Ron's negotiating skills we were able to drop the price significantly. I found the perfect place and could not have done it without Ron's assistance. Even after my move in he still offered his services and answered any questions I had. I would HIGHLY recommend Ron to anyone looking for a realtor who will work in your best interest. Currently I am looking to sell my place and have listed it with Ron.

It was my first time going through the selling AND buying experience and never really know what to expect but of course our goal was to sell a generous amount over asking and to buy for a reasonable price according to the current market. I am not sure exactly how many years experience Ron has, but I know it's a significant amount because of his outstanding work ethic. Ron guided us with so much patience through the process, taking every pre-caution and all the necessary steps to ensure our condo sold way above asking - with a total of 15 written offers!!! And also at times he may have discouraged us from making offers on a number of townhouses because he knew from his experience and intuition in the industry that we would soon enough find a home that better fits all the descriptions of our dream home 😍 It was surprisingly a pretty quick process for us, 4 weeks or so from completing the purchase  to completing the sale. We are forever grateful to have the connection with Ron Parpara-Realtor and the privilege to have him assist us in the very best way possible during this live changing time of lives. Thank-You Ron Parpara-Realtor!!!",

He's also quite attuned to the general preferences of different cultural groups, which helps him consider resale factors for his clients.\n\nRon is also honest to admit if he's not too knowledgeable about an area, rather than make up information to tell his clients. Having someone honest to guide you through Vancouver real estate is a huge benefit.\n\nRon wasn't my first realtor, but he is now my preferred realtor.",

I felt he was very detail oriented and was wholly working in the interests of his client. Even though this was a small job for him, I got the feeling that he was giving his 100% and not slacking just because it might've not paid as much.\n\nThat was 100% the reason that when we needed someone to sell our Yaletown apartment at Richards Living, I called up Ron and asked if he would be interested. We wanted someone who would treat every job equally and give it 100% they had - big or small. Throughout the entire process he was in communication with us, gave us regular updates, and handled everything (getting photos, doing showings, handling repairs, etc). When issues came up, he quickly dealt with it. I would say, working with Ron really exemplifies the saying \"when you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all\". There was little we had to do from our end, because Ron was able to manage everything seamlessly when issues arose (and they did arise) and when things needed to be taken care of. There is nothing else I could mention about Ron that the other 50 reviews haven't.\n\nI wholly recommend Ron for his professionalism, ease of communication, skill in negotiating with other parties, and his eagerness to handle everything and adapt to any unexpected issues that arose. I would say he is definitely one realtor who earned his paycheck and provided significant value to us as his clients.",

He has been extremely helpful and knowledgeable in the process after completion, helping me navigate the new responsibilities as a first time homeowner. There seems to be quite a few shady realtors that we came across in the home buying process and Ron has the proper judgement and intellect to make sure you are fully protected.",

This saved us a tremendous amount of time and allowed us to quickly respond in a hot real estate market. When we eventually found the one, Ron expertly guided us in carefully writing the winning offer.\n\nThen it was time to sell the apartment and this is where Ron's 10+ year experience as a realtor really shined through. He organized a professional team of painters, cleaner, stagers, and photographer that quickly made our apartment look its best! Over the course of one week including an open house weekend, Ron attracted over 80 potential buyers, out of which 15 wrote offers at or above asking price.\n\nMy wife and I are very thankful we chose Ron for the job. He went above and beyond, absolutely exceeding expectations.",

I ended up getting a home in the Shaugnessy neighborhood. He negotiated a very good deal for a superb home. Not only did he go to great lenghts and many showings to find us the right home, but he was also very patient (as we had three small children accompany us through all of it), gave us valuable advice since we were not only unfamiliar with the local market, but also with Canada in general. Ron showed great talent to match the showings to the type of home we were looking for and advised us away from risky deals. Ron is very professional and hard working, available from early in the morning until late at night and through the weekends. I trusted him 100% the entire time to find nothing but the best deal for us. I would not hesitate to recommend him to family, friends, or colleagues. Thanks, Ron!",

He used his experience and expertise to help me successfully sell my condo in Lower Lonsdale and purchase one at a preferred location in Pacific Point, Yaletown of approximately the same size and at a lower price. This turned out to be a very pleasant surprise because the prices in Yaletown are usually considerably higher than on the North Shore.\n\nThe task of selling my condo was a challenging one. In addition to major construction going on directly in front of my building and a dark kitchen, the market had been changing and really slowing down. Also, there were 6 other units that went up for sale in the same building complex, around the same time! Ron however, developed a marketing strategy which included professional staging, photos, repairs, advertising and open houses every weekend. We had many interested visitors and offers that soon followed. My unit was the first to sell out the 7 and with Ron’s help, negotiated a record breaking price which considering current market trends was impressive. Then, he helped me locate and negotiate a corner unit suite in Yaletown at a lower price!\n\nEven though the contractors he recommended were hit and miss, I was overall satisfied with his service.",

He makes real estate fun because he is passionate about what he does. He is a true professional in every sense of the word. But he is also *so* caring. He doesn't miss any detail and is always there to help, even after a purchase. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone looking to buy their first home or make their first investment. Or if you are that someone who wants to take advantage of something 'hot' on the market, Gaëtan will show it to you. And you'll never look back.",

In first appointment we were so amazed with his knowledge about Vancouver housing market and he gave us very helpful advise.\n\nWe were so picky about our next condo and it took us around 5 months to find our perfect place in Coal harbour area.

We looked at many apartments and although there were many miss matches it never once felt that he was trying to push me towards a sale. He show cased an extreme objectivity to my every request and was kind enough to give me the utmost honest opinion he could. All-in-all, while there is an ever growing abundance of real estate agents, it can be fair to assume that poaching prospective clientele may be at a real estate agents top priority. However, Gaeton never once fell short as a true to heart salesman and he never once put his interests above mine. In my opinion, the only shortcoming of my experience was that I was never notified that some real estate agents refund a portion of their commission back to their clients. Despite this, I would highly recommend Gaeton for he has exceptional customer service and a keen eye for what's hot on the market.",

      "text": "As we were looking to buy our first condo in Yaletown, we spent over three months searching independently before we finally decided to find a real estate agent. We had placed a bid on a home and were outbid once before we realized that we might not actually understand the Vancouver real estate process as much as we thought we did. When we started looking for a realtor, we did not think we were going to find someone who could legitimately help us. We were really just looking for someone to act as a middle man, as we were tired of looking on our own. When we started working with Gaetan, we realized we were going to get far more than that.\n\nFirst of all, he was always ready to take our calls and would always respond to emails in a prompt manner. Whenever we would try to get in touch with him, he would either answer immediately or call us back as soon as possible—but he also never answered a call while he was with us, which we really appreciated.\n\nSecond, he helped us evaluating what we wanted and what we needed so he could only show us condos that were actually viable options. Gaetan sent us emails with all the 2 bedroom condos for sell in Yaletown that were in our price range. He scheduled showings and guided us through the neighbourhood, he was very knowledgeable and familiar with most of the buildings we looked at. We received full information for each condo and he always provided us with all recent sales in each buildings.\n\nHe never influenced our decision until we asked him to do so. That was another reason we felt comfortable working with him, Gaetan was very patient, he was calm, even during the buying process. He made an effort to get to know us personally, and really acted more like a friend with real estate knowledge than like a buying real estate agent.\n\nIf you are looking for a realtor, Gaetan should be at the top of your list. He works hard for his clients and in the end helped us purchase the perfect condo.",
