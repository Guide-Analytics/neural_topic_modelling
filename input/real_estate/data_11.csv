"I really can't say enough about how great this experience has been, working with Alison and Connie. As first time homebuyers, we were wracked with self-doubt and hesitation, and many many questions. The learning curve has been steep! Alison and Connie provided the scaffolding for that learning. They patiently outlined many scenarios of how this could play out, listing all the pros and cons of various choices so that we could make our way to what was right for us. In the end, the decision that we made is far more informed and grounded than we could have imagined. They brought a genuine sense of care for this huge life decision, and we never felt pressured to go one way or another, only supported to make the choice that was right for us.","26 May, 2021",Rupinder Sidhu," East, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-15 18:57:57.664418,2021-06-15 18:58:00.707495,Roland Kym PREC & Connie Buna PREC Listing Specialists KymBuna Real Estate Group
"It was a pleasure working with our agent and her team. I do not like having to make real estate decisions, but throughout this process our agent made the experience positive. Information about new properties was updated daily or more often, discussions about relevant factors that were important to us but not evident from listings were provided, visits to places we were interested in looking at were arranged in a timely manner, and discussions about the properties was frank and apparently unbiased. Our agent knew the area and prospective properties really well, which facilitated decision making. The sale of our current place was managed exceedingly well, as was the ultimate purchase of a new property. If I had to go through this process again, I would gladly work with our agent and her team, and have no reservations recommending them to others.","24 May, 2021",Bill Bowie," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-15 18:57:57.664418,2021-06-15 18:58:00.707495,Roland Kym PREC & Connie Buna PREC Listing Specialists KymBuna Real Estate Group

As first time buyers, we felt overwhelmed and confused at the prospect of buying but Connie was there to support us 100% of the way. We learnt a lot from Connie, she took the time to teach us about what to look for in a condo, what to avoid and the communities we were interested in. At times, we thought we would never find a home with a relatively ""small"" budget for greater Vancouver but Connie was always there to pick up our spirits and ensure that in time we would find the right place for us; and we did, trusting fully that we made the right purchase as we had Connie guiding us through.
We also had the pleasure of working with Vicky, who was so flexible and organized. Vicky was always on time, if not early, she always responded to her emails in record time and made viewings happen when we gave her short notice. Vicky made pros and cons lists for each viewing, this was extremely beneficial. Vicky was a joy to get to know and we fully trusted her judgment as well.

"Connie was enthusiastically referred to us by two different couples that we know from two completely different social circles in Vancouver. As first time buyers and long time renters, we were admittedly nervous about the process of dipping our toes into Vancouver real estate. However, during our very first meeting, Connie's professionalism and in-depth knowledge about the different neighbourhoods and types of properties available in East Van put us at ease. She took our various ideas and preferences about the type of home we would like to have, and immediately identified a development near Trout Lake that we may be interested in (sure enough, the development that Connie identified is the very same one which we ultimately bought in to!). In between our first meeting and finding our home, Connie toured us through a number of properties in different East Van neighbourhoods, shared her valuable perspective on the properties and communities that we were seeing, and gave us ""homework"" to do that would help with our home search. Throughout this process, Connie was a great listener; she took in our feedback and adjusted our search accordingly, and we never felt pressured to move our home search in a direction that was not true to our values or goals. Because of all of the work that Connie put into our home search, we knew that our home was ""the one"" by the time we found it.

The team offers custom marketing materials, and they explained that this can be especially beneficial for homes like ours with interior renovations but original exterior condition. We actually saw people stopping on the street to look at our custom sign and materials! Throughout the entire process, we felt we were getting personal attention, expert communication, and a lot of 'extras' that other realtors don't offer. We trust Connie and her team fully, and ended up selling our home in 24 hours thanks to her flexibility with showings and assertive strategizing. After the sale, the team was just as responsive - answering questions, providing updates, and sending us helpful to do lists of next steps for completing the sale.

"Buying a property always seemed like an intimidating, complex process. Connie Buna helped keep everything clear and easily understandable - from making our initial offer, through every bit of paperwork, to closing the sale.

"Some realtors look at someone by their appearance or first impression and let that dictate the rest of the relationship moving forward and some lack the communication/personal skills. Justin was the opposite, he was unbiased, knowledgeable, responsive, and courteous during my purchase of my new home. Not once did he show any frustration even though I was demanding and kept changing my criteria for a home. Instead he just went with the flow, provided his incite and promptly updated his listings which helped me find my new home within a month. I would recommend Justin over the handful of realtors I had experienced any day.","06 May, 2020",Tony Young,,5.0,2021-06-15 18:57:57.664418,2021-06-15 18:58:00.707495,Roland Kym PREC & Connie Buna PREC Listing Specialists KymBuna Real Estate Group

We took a lot of time to buy as it was our first time entering the housing market. We had a lot of questions and our realtor was very patient with us and didn’t pressure us to buy before we were ready. When we were finally ready to buy our realtor was there to guide us through every step of the process. Everything went smoothly and we are so happy with our new home! We also received some great referrals from our realtor for businesses such as a home inspector and insurance broker. We had great experiences using both of the referrals.

"Our circumstances as sellers were a little special in that the condo we needed to sell was in Vancouver while our home is on Salt Spring Island. Kym and his team made this long-distance process quite painless. They maintained excellent communication about the progress of the listing, were very helpful for our tenants, did a terrific job photographing the suite to make it look actually quite a bit nicer that I would have thought it could be made to look. Once an offer was made and accepted, Kym was very helpful in facilitating a number of things that, had we lived in Vancouver, would certainly have been our responsibility to look after. All in all, I can't think of a better realtor for us to have listed with, especially from a distance.
