9,"This is the second time Brian has helped us. We were struggling to find our perfect home in the perfect location. Because he knew exactly what we were looking for, Brian contacted us immediately when the ideal listing popped up. He has previous experience with so many locations and so many buildings that is is able to easily match a client to a place with everything they are looking for.

12,"Brian was an excellent real estate agent for us as first time home buyers. We initially looked in Vancouver, but expanded our search to include the lower mainland, and Brian was flexible with looking for homes all over. He was professional, helpful throughout the process of contact with sellers, negotiations, inspection and completion. He scheduled showings for us on very little lead-time, he was always punctual, he shared his helpful opinion of why certain properties had certain value(or lack there of). We eventually found the home we were looking for, and Brian helped us get it for the price we felt was fair.

As first time home buyers, he helped us to understand the buying process, answering our many questions, and guiding us through every step of the way.

15,"Moving home to Vancouver after some 50 years living in the ""Centre of Canada"" (Toronto??), it was very important that I have a realtor who could sift thru the many homes that were on the market and find one having much of my criteria: 2 stories and a 2-car garage for my vintage Thunderbirds. I made a preliminary trip in January to look at availability and from the get-go, I have to say the Brian exceeded my expectations and before going back, I settled on our new home. He delivered - and my wife agreed on a trip out shortly thereafter. Brian did exactly what I wanted and we are truly enjoying our new life in Tsawwassen with huge thanks to him!! It could not have ended any better.","17 July, 2020",Bruce Charkow," Tsawwassen, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 13:11:02.459328,2021-06-17 13:11:05.190704,Brian MacDougall
16,"I just recently completed my purchase through Brian and am very happy with his service. As someone new to the province who didn’t know anyone, I spoke with 3-4 realtors before finding Brian. While we weren’t ready to buy when we first met with him, he was so nice and helpful that once we were ready a couple months later, we were sure to contact him again. (He also kept in touch during this time sending us listings to review). It was amazing how easy he was to work with, meeting us in different cities and all different times. He also offered lots of great advice that we weren’t hearing from selling agents etc. We are so thankful for all the little tidbits he helped out with that we would have never thought of. All the way to the end, even with several weeks gone by after our purchase, Brian is still rechecking in and ensuring we have a smooth process.","02 July, 2020",Kyle Greene," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 13:11:02.459328,2021-06-17 13:11:05.190704,Brian MacDougall

28,I recently purchased a home with Brian MacDougall as my real estate representative. It was a nontraditional purchase (mobile home) on native land. There were therefore complexities in the process. Brian professionally guided me through this process including directing me to other services that were required and are sometimes difficult to find for this type of mobile home purchase. I felt he was always readily available to me and was very prompt in replying to me throughout the process.

30,"Brian came highly recommended to us by a friend. We were nervous about buying our first home and as soon as our first meeting with Brian was completed we knew that we were going to be in good hands. Brian made us feel at ease and walked us through the process step by step. He took the time to listen carefully to what we were looking for and helped guide us on what would be realistic and what wouldn’t. As our search began Brian would always make the viewings light-hearted and fun, at the same time as taking every opportunity to educate us on different parts of the buying cycle. His sense of humor coupled with his robust knowledge of the real estate market made the process a far more interesting one than we were expecting. As the search continued..and continued…this is where Brian really came into his own; it seemed that we decided that until we had seen most homes in the Lower Mainland we would be unable to make a final decision. Brian stuck it out with a smile, equally informed ‘tours’ and he worked hard to get us a property that we love. We so appreciated Brain’s patience with us. He was always available for any questions or concerns we had. He even walked us through every stage of the closing of a sale, page by page, so we knew what to expect. We also appreciated Brian’s experience and knowledge of the market, which helped us make an informed decision and made us think about aspects of purchasing a home that we might not have necessarily considered. We will definitely be recommending Brian to anyone in our network looking to buy! Thanks for making the experience such a great one!","30 July, 2019",Tom Coules," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 13:11:02.459328,2021-06-17 13:11:05.190704,Brian MacDougall

34,"Working with Brian was an easy decision as I had a very positive experience with him in the past. Bringing Brian, along with Stephen on-board for the recent sale of our home proved to be another great decision. Most notable about this team was their ability to always--and we do mean always--conduct their business in a client-centred fashion. Indeed, the conversation has always been about our goals and what they can do to help achieve them. Brian and Stephen have unique skillsets that not all realtors possess: the ability to be genuinely personable and yet extremely professional; they consistently presented us with key facts every step of the way, especially when we felt 'emotional' in our decision-making. They were calm, measured and thus helped us to make well-informed decisions that resulted in a sale that made us happy. Thank you Brian and Stephen for everything. We simply cannot thank you enough!","27 April, 2019",Jason & Atoosa K.,,5.0,2021-06-17 13:11:02.459328,2021-06-17 13:11:05.190704,Brian MacDougall
35,"Brian went above and beyond helping us with the sale of our home and purchase of our condo in 2016, and again with the sale of our condo in 2019. He gave us all of the advice we required, always responded to our many inquiries, and with his calm manner, was able to make us feel 100% confident that he could get the job(s) done for us as quickly and professionally as possible.

36,"We came to Brian via a recommendation from our friends but no idea what to expect when we first contacted him as we had no knowledge of the Canadian housing market and had not spoken to any other realtors in the Vancouver area. Brian immediately made us feel comfortable and safe with both his friendliness and knowledge not only of the housing market but also of the house purchase process, and gave us a step by step guide of what we could expect through this process. Brian was able to help us articluate what we were looking for in a house, what areas we were interested in living in and what our budget was so he could search for suitable properties, and over a very short period of time was able to show us properties meeting our needs and then tune his search for properties based on our feedback on what worked and did not work for us from the property viewing he had organised for us. Within a month Brian had found our ideal home for us that matched not only most of our housing ammenity needs but was also in the location we wanted (but did not think we could afford) and gave us great value for our square footage! Not an easy task when you are trying to find a reasonable priced and sized home for a family of four in Kitsilano! Brian was outstanding through our bid process and was in communication with us almost hourly every step of the way! No time was too late or too early for him to be talking to us and the seller's realtor to submit offers and negotiate counter offers, offering freindly advice to us on how to respond based on his experience in the market as well as his professional relationships with most of the local realtors in the Vancouver area. Brian was also able to offer us advice (at our request) on who to speak to regarding mortgage and insurance options, housing inspections and appraisals as well as legal services which made this normally very stressful process much more managable and easy. They say that moving house is one of the top three most stressful things you can do in your life but with Brian's help and guidance through this process we are genuinely excited to be moving into the home of our dreams! Thank you so much to you and Stephen for everything you have done for us.

37,"This is the second time I have worked with Brian. The reason I decided to work with Brian again is simply because on the first occasion I was extremely pleased with his professionalism and support throughout the complete process of the purchase. On this second occasion, Brian worked diligently to help me, not only did he help me with the sale of my old home, he also followed through and completed the process with the purchase of new one. In the past I have recommended Brian's services to my friends and co-workers, and I will continue to do so in the future, knowing his work ethic and how he steadfastly follows through on his commitments.

Brian kept in touch and also kept us appraised of current market activities. Once we were ready, Brian represented us with courtesy and professionalism. It didn't take long to find our dream home and Brian was with us during every step of the process. Buying or selling in real estate can be complicated, but Brian guided us through every detail, which made it seem easy.

42,"Brian's expertise and thoroughness in assisting in purchasing a condo in Vancouver was exemplary. He kept my husband and I up to date on changes in the condo market and promptly answered any questions we had. We are from the States and permanently relocating to Vancouver so we were totally unfamiliar with resources, etc. We feel without Brian's knowledge and expertise of other competent and knowledgable professionals and resources in Vancouver, we would have been totally lost. Brian's integrity, patience, promptness of response and knowledge of real estate is outstanding. We feel so fortunate that he was the real estate person that we got to work with.

45,"I would like to thank Brian and Steve for their professionalism, courtesy, and commitment to make my first time home buying experience to be as seamless as possible from the beginning all the way through home inspection, and closing process.

With so many realtors to choose from and no personal references, I found myself rolling the dice and I'm glad to know that I've made the right decision.

Thanks to their negotiating skills, not only that I was able to find a suitable place for my current needs but also at a price point that fits my budget without stretching myself to the limit.
