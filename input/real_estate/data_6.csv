Lindsie helped us with advice on our condo renovations before listing on the market to sell. What renovation work was worth undertaking to benefit most in our ultimate goal to sell quickly at the highest value. In the end we sold our condo above asking with multiple offers.","01 June, 2021",Betty Pang," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",4.21,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie Thomlinson spear fished us a dream from thirty thousand feet and made it a reality and is, in our estimation, one of the greatest people to have ever lived. There are four letter words for people like Lindsie, and one of them is 'Hero'. It's hard to describe just how much of a serious sense of duty of care that Lindsie exhibited at every step of the way in the process, but I will say that it astonished us both the clear eyed seriousness, patience, and deliberate capability that Lindsey exercised at each turn of the Sisiphyean struggle that is navigating the snakepit of the Vancouver real estate market. Lindsie will fight for you, Lindsie will make it happen, and Lindsie will deliver. Lindsie got us our dream home for about 50 grand under our budget. And if that doesn't get your attention then I don't know what does. Buying a home is serious business even if it's not your entire your life savings, and as a professional researcher and analyst I have to say I was astonished at the thoroughness and due diligence that Lindsie employed to find even the slightest hint of red flags that would indicate a risk to our investment. Lindsie went the distance in every respect and that much farther to make sure that we steered clear of significant risk. People say you can't put a price on that, and they would be wrong. I don't think the kind of people who would say that work for their money, but I do, and I bet you do too. Lindsie, underneath her consummate professionalism and cheerful yet diplomatic disposition is a ruthless scrapper that will make the deal happen for you and get you to the front of the line. She had our interests at heart with a determination and zeal that we did not expect but are happy as hell to have on our side. She was, and dare I say it, monklike in her focused and skillful negotiation of the purchase of our property. We were in a situation where someone had delisted the property out of frustration with the market. We were absolutely crushed. Lindsie didn't just get us in the door she took a crowbar to the situation and made it happen and that friends and neighbors is the place that we landed at a price that would make you whistle. Like I said we got it for 50k under our budget, and I'll tell you now we got more value than we expected going into this thing by a mile. That's the thing with Lindsie. She wins. Lindsie's communication is beyond reproach. And by that we mean it's almost scary just how on the ball she is, facilitating and smoothing every last little thing over. Think you should ask her about something? I swear she already knows what you're thinking and you would think she was already wiring her reply before you started writing the text. That's a good thing when you're in this situation. Lindsie doesn't just work for you, she WORKS for you. She did all of this in the midst of the second wave of the pandemic. And she made every single viewing happen like clockwork. Lindsie is also great at protecting you from your worst enemy when you're buying a house: yourself. Anyone wanting to save themselves marriage counselling fees or any amount of grief would be well served to choose Lindsie as their realtor. If you've read this far you're probably asking yourself two questions: why haven't I already started writing a Lindsie an email? And what else is awesome about Lindsie? I can't answer the first question for you. Maybe you don't want to win. But if you do, then you should start writing that email. As far as the second question is concerned the other awesome thing about Lindsie besides the fact that she is one of the most sincere, effective, and driven people I've met is that she's a genuinely good human being. She won one for the good guys for us, and you would choose another realtor at your peril after being cautioned to this effect. I wish you good luck in your housing search, but you'll need a lot less of it with Lindsie on your side. All best.","28 April, 2021",Rob and Angie lutener,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie was FANTASTIC in helping me with my first property sale. Her professionalism, effort, and communication are top notch. With the Lower Mainland market being very hot at the moment, Lindsie was very patient with me and my family this last few months during the hunt for a property.  She clearly takes pride in her work and provides honest feedback and timely responses to help reduce the stress in making your important property decision.  She is personable, follows through, and is thorough in explaining each step of the home buying process. I truly respect how Lindsie communicates in a way that does not make you feel pressured to offer more than you are willing.  She has a wonderful ability to bridge buyers and sellers and I would recommend her to first time buyers looking for a realtor who will work on your side.  Future clients will be lucky to have Lindsie working with you! THANK YOU Lindsie!","12 April, 2021",Maureen Mui,,4.93,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We had an outstanding experience with Lindsie! She made purchasing our first home a fun experience! She was open and honest about the various places we looked at and knew instantly the place we bought would be the perfect fit for us - and she was so right. We are so happy in our new home. Can’t recommend Lindsie enough. Her communication was excellent - she’d always call us back the same day and get answers to us very quickly.","09 April, 2021",Nicci Harris," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We worked with Lindsie when we wanted to make an offer and our realtors were conflicted out due to another client wanting to offer on the same property, and she was amazing. In fact, I specifically asked her to let me know where I could review her excellent service. In a time-sensitive situation, she was exceptionally responsive, communicative, and diligent (on a holiday weekend, no less!). As first-time buyers considering our first-ever offer, we didn't feel ready to offer way over asking price, and she was completely non-pressuring, even though this property seemed certain to receive multiple offers (and did in fact sell for way over asking, just as Lindsie predicted). She listened us and respected our boundaries 100%, while also offering her frank (and correct) assessment of the strategy that would be needed to make our bid successful. We were blown away by how hard she worked for us without much likelihood of being compensated for her time, given that we are not regular clients and were not interested in making a really high offer on this property. Although we had already toured the property with our regular realtors, she made a special appointment to visit the property on her own and look at an area of possible structural concern. She told us that she won't write on a property without having seen it (impressive professional standards!). She also reviewed the strata docs on a tight timeline and offered her knowledgeable, honest take on the building's pros and cons. I appreciate the fact that she is such a frank and clear communicator in an industry where it's tough sometimes to know what you are really getting and how much to read between the lines. Although we worked with Lindsie only briefly, I feel very confident recommending her if you are looking for a realtor who is experienced, forthright, responsive, thorough, and genuinely kind.","07 April, 2021",Alana P,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie was a phenomenal agent. In selling our property during a highly unusual time, she was able to get our desired price when other properties in our neighbourhood sat much longer and went for well under their asking price. She was always available by text (our preferred method of communicating!) and followed up whenever we had questions. She never batted an eye when we had unusual requests or questions and did her homework.
She understood our needs for purchasing a home and did an amazing job of navigating the needs of both of us! She also helped us by providing many options for supports (i.e. how do we find a painter? a lawyer? etc.). She always provided several options and left us to make any selection we wanted to without any pressure to choose someone she had recommended.
We would recommend Lindsie without reservation.","02 February, 2021",Lesley Dampier," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

My experience with Lindsie was nothing short of positive in every step of the way. I think what I appreciated most about dealing with her is her realistic approach. She did not promise me the sun, moon and stars, but I knew from our first encounter that she would work tirelessly to do whatever she could within her power to bring offers to me that would exceed my expectations and she did just that!! Within one week I accepted one of 3 offers that was well over asking and I was thrilled! That was on a Monday in late October and by the following Thursday evening the deal was done!! Then came the challenge of finding a new home. Lindsie knew from our many conversations what I was looking for and what my “deal breakers” were and from that she scheduled several appointments. The second listing we looked at I knew from the moment I walked in the door that it was exactly what I was looking for. She knew the neighborhood well and thought it would be the perfect location for me. She left my mom and I to continue looking at what I knew with 100% certainty was my new home while she went downstairs to have a chat with the sellers realtor. After we left she did some homework on the area and recent sales and then she called me to discuss and advise what she thought I should offer. I trusted her completely and agreed with her. She then made the call and at that time found out we were in a multiple offer situation. I was on pins a needles until she called me back with the exciting news that they accepted my offer!!! It was a whirlwind from the moment I decided to sell the townhouse I had lived in for 17 years to finding my new home and Lindsie was there every step of the way. There was a mishap with the movers I hired and they damaged the banister when they were moving me out of the old house and I called Lindsie to let her know. She asked me to send her photos of the damage and the moving company’s contact info and she took care of it!! I did not expect that but was so relieved when she took that on. Selling and buying new, moving etc during a pandemic was stressful at times and I did encounter a few personal hiccups along the way and Lindsie was there to assist me through the entire process and I was very grateful for that!! I’ve now been in my new home for about 6 weeks and I LOVE it!!!! Thank you Lindsie!!!!","03 January, 2021",Viola Lively," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We had a fantastic time working with Lindsie, she is a top notch communicator with a no nonsense attitude when it came to negotiating. We had some highs and lows during the sale of our apartment, of which were out of our control. With her reassurance she made sure we stayed positive and patient through the entire ride.

Lindsie was very supportive of us as first-time home buyers. We were excited but overwhelmed by the amount of things to consider, and not always knowing where to place our trust. She was always professional but friendly and honest with her thoughts and suggestions. Lindise helped guide us but supported our choices and showed patience as we sometimes struggled. Her industry contacts and knowledge were a great asset, and we always felt accommodated when we had a question.","07 November, 2020",Sean Dobbyn,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie was the perfect agent for us. We moved to Vancouver from Toronto and she did an amazing job of managing our expectations and assisting with the purchase of our new home from 4000 km away! Once we arrived in Vancouver we hit the ground running and within a week Lindsie helped us to narrow down our search parameters, hone in on our must-haves and ideal neighbourhoods and quickly purchase a new home that we are over the moon excited about. We cannot say enough good things about Lindsie and her approach to real estate. She is level headed, professional while still being warm and caring (buying a new home can be stressful!). While we plan to stay in this home for a while, we can't wait to work with Lindsie again when the time comes and in the meantime we recommend her to all of our family and friends.","31 October, 2020",Calla Evans," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie is an excellent realtor. We were looking for out-of-town property for about 10 years and have met many realtors in both our selling and buying communities. Lindsie definitely was the cream of the crop and helped us sell our older/small lot Vancouver house during a pandemic for exactly the price we needed - in fact the best price we could have hoped for. Good things about Lindsie: no-pressure, completely understanding and patient and a really nice person. I especially appreciate that she's principled and honest; she won't lie to anyone. But she was also able to get the job done well and on time, keep us focussed, set and meet all deadlines and follow-up on all questions and concerns (and I had a lot), and was always ready to share her considerable knowledge about real estate transactions. At the end she even contacted our lawyer for us to make sure the sale documents were going to go through conveyance on time, when our lawyer was being a bit troublesome. To adapt to the pandemic, she showed our house in sequential appointments for one buyer at a time which was the most labour-intensive for her and the best advantage for us. She was even extra-kind to our vulnerable tenant. It would be hard to list all the things she did as she worked really hard to make the sale and even provided a lot of extra advice to us on our rural purchase in another community when it ended up being very complicated. There were a lot of reasons why we were finally able to move to a stunning rural acreage, but it's also true that without Lindsie I'm not sure it would have happened. Thanks Lindsie!","18 September, 2020",A R," East, Vancouver",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

I cannot recommend Lindsie enough to potential buyers who are looking for an incredibly trustworthy, knowledgable and clever realtor. Lindsie represented us as buyers in one of the toughest and most competitive markets - she takes the time to really understand her buyers and we never felt pressure from her. She did; however, know when and how and when to arm us with the kind of competitive edge it takes to nab a dream home in an incredibly competitive market. She is absolutely who you should trust, whether you are buying or selling, to act in your best interests and help you achieve your goals in real estate.","31 August, 2020",Kristen Suess, Eddystone Crescent,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We are so blessed to have her as our selling agent. From the first moment we were on the call with her to the closing of the sale of our condo, Lindsie provided a service above and beyond our expectations. Her friendly, responsive, knowledgeable and dedicated manner made us so comfortable and relieved our stress. She guided us through the selling process with her detailed market evaluation, pricing expertise, the extraordinary staging effort, and negotiation of the sale. We received offers right after the open house. She made every step of the sale of our condo an easy and stress-free process and achieved more than what we wished for.

Lindsie was instrumental in helping us secure the house of our dreams. After 15 years of living in Vancouver, and with a growing family of 4, we decided to make the move to Kelowna. We knew right away that we wanted Lindsie as our realtor. When we learned that Kelowna was outside her region and that she wouldn’t be our real estate agent, we were initially disappointed. But as it turns out, Lindsie was the perfect person to facilitate our move. She immediately got us in touch with an excellent mortgage broker who had us pre-approved within days. She then referred us to an Okanagan-based real estate agent who arranged to do a virtual walk-through of the property 2 days later. After our offer was accepted, Lindsie sent us additional referrals to lawyers and notaries in Vancouver who helped us finalize the sale of the house. Even though Lindsie wasn’t our realtor, she ended up facilitating the entire real estate process. Not only is she friendly and professional, all of her referrals were top-notch. We are convinced that without her help, we would not have found our dream home in Kelowna.","15 June, 2020",Priscille B," Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

My wife and I finally found the perfect home for us, but so did 34 other prospective buyers. Having Lindsie on our team meant that we were equipped with the information and advice we needed to formulate a plan that not only kept us in the running during a very intense bidding process, but ultimately landed us the home we've always wanted. During the very short timeframe we had to view the house and make an offer, Lindsie was there with us during the open house to help assess how the house actually matched up to our wishlist, helped us understand and plan around the findings of the home inspection, and was instrumental in making an offer that got noticed. The best part is that even after coming out victorious in such a hot bidding war, we feel like we got a great deal and can't wait to grow old in our new home.","14 June, 2020",Ernie Bin,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We got to know Lindsie through a coworker. She has been a godsend. We tried to do our home search with a different agent, but I felt so uninformed, rushed and pressured to make the purchase. However, Lindsie has been so patient. We don't have a feeling that we are just one of her many clients. I Wil recommend her to anyone.","01 February, 2020",Thomas Ng," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We cannot imagine a better Real Estate Agent! Lindsie was recommended to us by our adult son, who had very good things to say, so we launched into a 2-year hunt with her for the perfect home in East Van - an area she is very knowledgeable about, (although for comparison we looked in other areas as well) Despite our exacting requirements, changing our minds, lugging grandchildren along for showings, etc, Lindsie was always thorough, very patient, always available for any questions we had and very dependable when it came to appointments and all sorts of details. We always felt we were getting excellent guidance and support- even as far as recommendations for tradespeople, renovation ideas, and helpful resources.after we had purchased. She really knows the area and the business! And she is a really nice person too ! Can't recommend too highly!","17 December, 2019",wendy Wulff," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

For a first-time buyer – who never thought they'd be able to buy in this market – Lindsie was a godsend. We looked at dozens of properties over a 10-month stretch, I was unsure of what I could truly afford, how to engage a broker, and the cost of renovations. Lindsie stewarded me through all of it with an insane amount of patience (and time spent answering my anxiety-ridden text messages!). I ultimately ended up in a neighbourhood I wouldn't have considered, with a gorgeous apartment (under budget) and I couldn't be happier. I cannot endorse Lindsie enough!","21 November, 2019",Samantha Wink, V3L 5H6,4.94,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie was great to work with. I'm a first time home buyer and it took me over a year to find a place I loved. Throughout the entire process Lindsie was supportive, consistent and reliable.

I would definitely recommend Lindsie to anyone trying to buy a home.","05 October, 2019",Claudia Nobauer," Ontario, Canada",4.86,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Despite the hot market Lindsie managed to get a good read on what the seller really needed. We ended up in our new home under asking price at a time when multiple competitive offers are the norm. She also informed us of certain risk asssociated with different properties and had a deep knowledge of the neighbourhoods helping us find a place that matched our lifestyle - Not being from the greater Vancouver region this knowledge was invaluable to us. She was there from the start to handing us our keys on Possession day. Would definitely recommend to family & friends.","21 August, 2019",MD Maillet," Langley, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We are first time homebuyers and with Lindsie's guidance and knowledge, we found our home within weeks of meeting her. She intuitively came to an open house with us without us even asking, and it ended up being THE one! She was professional, realistic, efficient and made us feel confident during the entire process.

I was not a homeowner when I met Lindsie. She was hired to sell the home we were renting when we decided to move back home to Ontario. Lindsie was always on time with her appointments, kept us in the loop with her communications and worked with us to minimize the impact of showings and open houses on our family of three young children. She even went above and beyond on moving day, helping look after our kids at the park while our boxes were being moved. If (when?) we come back to Vancouver we already know who will help us find a home.","07 May, 2019",Michael Lelli, Avenue E,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Thank goodness Lindsie had an excellent understanding of Eastside properties and was patient. The long search begin in March 2018 when there was still bidding wars and offers with no subjects. It was an emotional process for this impatient, determined person but Lindsie kept me even-keeled, focused, open to options and supported. Lindsie has a great nose for potential issues, literally.... human mold detector... had great building knowledge & excellent negotiation skills. I always felt very confident with her capabilities in representing my needs & making herself available via text, phone, emails and showings. Lindsie is very professional & I could tell well respected in the industry which must help when it comes to dealing with other agents and offer presentations. One piece of the real estate puzzle that I learned was incredibly valuable is the mortgage broker! Mine dropped the ball (huge ball) on a few occasions so I did change to one of the brokers recommended by Lindsie and was thrilled with their expertise and efficiency in helping me get through the process as I needed an insurer with less than 20% down. The market settled down a little, I knew better what I wanted (after an exhausting hunt) and found my dream condo. The minute Lindsie & I walked through I think we both got chills at the same time, looked at each other & when she saw the tears of amazement welling up in my eyes she got to work the minute we walked out. Thanks to Lindsie’s patience, understanding, humor & hard work....December 2018... I’m home!","29 January, 2019",Michele Hannah," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

In a market like Vancouver, there are a million realtors, and it can be overwhelming to choose one. Its a big decision to make, and an important one, when you are talking millions of dollars. A realtor can either make or break your sale. I knew finding a realtor that was going to meet my expectations would be difficult, since I am told I'm a perfectionist...(insert shy smile here). To top it off, I found myself unexpectedly 5000 miles away from my home of 17 years, so I couldn't even be the hands-on-do-it-your-selfer that I am. It was rough... But choosing Lindsie was the best decision ever, and made the whole ""could be a nightmare situation"" a walk in the park. Lindsie was easy to reach at all times, she knew the market well, she knew what was out there that would compete with my home, and why those places were or weren't selling. Lindsie kept me informed of all happenings, she was updating me daily at times, and went above and beyond when it came to making my home show well. She even used some of her own staging props, and went out and bought a few greens for the barren veggie garden at my request. The write up and photos she had taken were excellent, and if I wanted something tweaked just a bit, I would ask and it would be done. She didn't seem to mind my endless stream of questions and requests and never hesitated to do what she could to facilitate things like letting in house cleaners or repair men. She was always a delight to chat with over the phone and even more delightful when we finally met in person at closing. She was great at adding humour to sometimes stressful situations and by the end of my first ""selling a home experience"" I must admit, I consider Lindsie a friend. :-) When I am ready to sell my other home, Lindsie will be my first call.","10 October, 2018",Claudette M,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie has been absolutely incredible working with and on behalf of us in our search for our first home. She was very tuned into our particular goals and tastes throughout our search. She provided terrific insight and honest advice, particularly on several properties that she knew were not quite right for us. We never felt rushed, and Lindsie made us feel as though we were her only client. And in the end, she helped us find an ideal home that was well below the top of our budget. We will be looking forward to working with her again in the future, and would recommend her to anyone.","12 August, 2018",Shane Czypyha," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie is a passionate and dedicated real estate realtor. During the time of apartment hunting in Vancouver, she listened to my needs, wants and concerns We worked together for more than two years. As a young professional, I appreciate how she had put together a comprehensive guide to buying your home in Vancouver and gave it to me when we first met at a coffee shop in 2016. She provided me with all the information I needed as a first time home buyer, and I really appreciated the guide - it's informative and concise!

Lindsie did a great job managing a complicated deal. We were in a chain with the person who wanted to buy our apartment. We had to wait for their offer to finalize but we also wanted to put in an offer on our dream home. Lindsie went above and beyond to keep the buyer's agent on schedule and was very proactive in resolving little issues that emerged last minute that were threatening to jeopardize the deal. It was great to have such a good negotiator and advocate!","24 February, 2018",April Van Ert," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

When it came time to buy a new place and sell our existing one, we did not hesitate at all to reconnect with Lindsie. She provided outstanding guidance and service as first-time buyers, so we fully trusted she would do the same the second time around, and we were not disappointed. We appreciate that Lindsie is honest with us, knows how to ask the right questions (of us and the properties we view), and balances her professionalism with genuine friendliness. With Lindsie's help, we found and bought a new place, easily sold our townhome (for well over asking!), and smoothly transitioned between homes. We always recommend her to anyone in need of a realtor.","23 February, 2018",Shane Pittman," British Columbia, Canada",4.93,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie is a fantastic realtor and an even better person! She took the time out to get to know us, our needs and dreams. After coming second in two bidding wars Lindsie took the time to sit down with us, refocus our approach and make sure we were all on the same page.

Lindsie represented us in the purchase of our house in Vancouver. She was flexible and accommodating with arranging viewings and providing feedback and advice. When we found the house we wanted to buy her biggest talents became apparent: she is a master at deal-making, and she devised a strategy to get us the best outcome from the situation (helping us to avoid a bidding war), then managed us and the seller's agent to execute it. Most impressive of all, she carefully managed the flow of information to us so as not to overwhelm us, or allow our emotions to get the better of us. Even the seller's agent told us what an excellent realtor we had. I cannot recommend her work more highly, and will definitely use her for our next real estate transaction.","07 January, 2018",Natalie Tsang,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie absolutely exceeded our expectations as a realtor. Her professionalism went above and beyond, and her help to us as first time home buyers was invaluable. She made us feel supported and heard through the whole process, and we just knew she had our best interest in mind. Her knowledge of the building we were interested in was very important for us and she left no questions unanswered. Even a year after our purchase we feel we can go back to Lindsie anytime with questions, not only about property but also the neighbourhood and Vancouver in general! Will definitely recommend her, and we will absolutely be enlisting her help again in the future!","21 December, 2017",Andrea Fernandez," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We recommend Lindsie without hesitation! We found Lindsie in the middle of our house search, at a time that we were experiencing significant buyers' fatigue. We had lost out on a few properties, using a different agent, and decided to make a switch. We could not be more thrilled that we did. Lindsie is fantastic. She is organized, professional and knowledgeable. She is easy to talk to and replies quickly to text messages. She helped us throughout every stage of the process and gave us actual, tangible advice and strategies (something we notice many other agents do not do). We are first time home buyers and she made the process as easy and stress free as possible. We strongly feel that we would not have won our property without Lindsie and her help. She truly made the difference in getting us our forever home.","02 November, 2017",Colleen Elden," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We cannot rave about our experience with Lindsie enough. This was our first time buying a home and Lindsie acted as our realtor, our confidante, and our friend. If we had to describe Lindsie in three words, they would be intelligence, integrity and charm.","30 October, 2017",Annika Chambers," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie was extremely helpful for the sale of our townhouse and purchase of a house. We looked at several different neighbourhoods in different cities/ towns (Vancouver and North Vancouver, Deep Cove) with her to purchase a house and she was knowledgeable about all of them. I found her to be honest, to the point, very professional and she expected other agents (e.g. those representing buyers) to also be professional. Her responses to questions and requests were very quick and timely. She understood our needs as a young family who was primarily interested in neighbourhood schools and a good neighbourhood. She was supportive when we were unsure and helped us through our decision making processes. I think Lindsie's honesty and communication are her strongest traits. I would highly recommend Lindsie as an agent for selling and/ or buying your property.","30 October, 2017",Brooke Bennett," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We met Lindsie at the first property we went to see, where she was the seller's agent. Connecting with her there we were very impressed - she was knowledgeable, friendly, and very receptive to the questions of a couple of first-time hopeful home-buyers. When we asked her to be our buyer's agent she set up an initial meeting to walk us through the process, understand what we wanted in a home and get to know our family. Over the next several months while we looked for a place in our neighbourhood, with a bit of outdoor space, and within our price range (a tricky find!) she came to several viewings with us, took time to answer our questions, supported us through 3 unsuccessful offers, and was - the entire time- a friendly, open ally in the process. When we decided to put an offer in on what finally became our home we thought it was going to be a multiple offer situation. Lindsie made the amazing move of calling the selling agent about 20 minutes before offers were due and found that it was not - saving us many thousands of dollars. I would highly recommend Lindsie!","19 September, 2017",Christie Wall," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

We used Lindsie to sell our old house and buy our new one in North Vancouver. Lindsie is knowledgeable and very conscientious. She followed up on every question and comment I made - even when on holiday. We took a long time to find our new house, but Lindsie was patient and happy to let us take our time until we found the right one.
Lindsie knows lots of people in the business and especially in East Van so if there is something she doesn't know herself, she finds out the answer pretty quickly anyway.
Lindsie is also just a really nice, helpful, friendly person to deal with - makes it much easier to go through a stressful process.
I recommend her 100%.","11 September, 2017",Jen Read," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie exceeded my expectations. I met her at an open house she was showing (agent-less and new to the process of home-buying). She is warm and personable but thoroughly pursued and investigated any issues or questions I had from the beginning of the process to the end.
She was able to deal with other realtors and opinionated family members graciously and professionally. Lindsie was always responsive and available for viewings and other appointments. She understood the market and the neighbourhood I was hunting in. Often she knew about buildings and their condition before I even viewed them. She wasn't afraid to tell me if it was ""bad"" or ""good"" and was always giving me updates on homes I was interested in. Her advice at the time of my purchase was totally invaluable and after the offer had been accepted she was still present and helpful (even after I was given the keys).","21 August, 2017",Tiana Coutts," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson

Lindsie is a super talented real estate whiz! She calmed my nerves on a daily basis, making a stressful experience calm and actually fun.

Honesty and integrity were the two most important characteristics I wanted in a realtor when I was selling my condo, looking for another and then subsequently buying. Not only did Lindsie fulfill my top criteria in every segment of the journey, but she also demonstrated other important skills such as experience, knowledge of the market and negotiation. She was reliable, accessible (promptly returned texts, phone calls, showed up on time for showings/meetings) and professional. Her friendly, personable patient manner made me feel comfortable asking any question. She also really listened to what I wanted, so time was not wasted looking at properties that were not suitable. My entire experience of buying and selling was positive because of Lindsie; therefore I do not hesitate to recommend her.","03 October, 2016",Carolyn Wong," Langley, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson
