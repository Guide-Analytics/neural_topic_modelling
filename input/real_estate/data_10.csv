He was very patient with us bringing us to numerous viewings over an entire year, which was much appreciated. We loved all the connections he shared with us and the people he introduced us to to help us with all the matters of purchasing a home.

15,"I remember when Jark helped us sell our home. He was strongly recommended to us by one of our best friend's and mentors in Vancouver and this was enough for us. We were just outside of Horseshoe Bay and had seldomly used the property as a vacation property over the last few years. Suffice to say it needed some TLC. Jark opened his rolodex of landscapers, stagers, renovators, septic tank service people, and in no time... we were listed and quickly sold. It was a treat to have someone take the reins and get a job done! We were so glad to have one less thing to thing about it and so glad to call him a friend!

Jark's patience and commitment was highlighted as he navigated us through the process and his optimism instilled confidence in us during this journey. However, our relationship with Jark did not end after the sale; rather, he's become a member of our family.

18,"I'm Harry and I'm a fan of Jark's. I look back at how we first me: We first met in 2011 when he changed my opinion about what an agent can do. From the past I didn't have the greatest experience with other agents. That was so... until, on a random weekend, I met Jark in my building when he was holding an open house for another client. We had a great chat in the lobby and elevators and the next day I asked him to write an offer for me for a family member in the same building. I didn't think it would work out as we had to compete on the property with other agents but his professionalism helped put the deal together. I look back at this time of my life and think of this experience and working with him and it's made all the difference. Thanks for taking great care of the rest of my family Jark, it's been a slice.

My young family and I relocated to Vancouver from China/Beijing and we knew very little about the process of buying and selling in Canada. We met a true human being who took the time to explain how things worked, baby steps at a time. We felt we could trust him from that first professional impression. Years later when we had a question about the contract for our accountant he was able to provide all the information to our accountant without any delay. We learned then as we did in 2010 that we have a truly reliable professional at our fingertips. Thanks for being there Jark.

39,"Got a condo from Jark like 5 years ago. Not only did we become very close friend from then on because of Jark‚Äôs honesty, professional real estate knowledge, and outstanding personality, but also we became business partners. I introduced him to lots of my close friends who‚Äôs in searching of houses and apartments. All those referrals to Jark, never did one single friend came to me disappointed. They were all amazed by the service and knowledge from Jark. Jark has also been an incredible mentor for me on my own business. This is the guy who always has ideas and solutions. Once you get to know this guy, you will know what I‚Äôm talking about.","22 May, 2019",Changtao Miao," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:38:28.060703,2021-06-17 15:38:30.928064,"Jark Krysinski *PREC, TeamYVR Real Estate Agents"
40,"Jark is a realtor extraordinaire! We met through a referral and I've been working with him since last year. I was looking to list my investment property with a realtor experienced in land assemblies, developing and building. I was elated to discover he has twenty plus years of experience in real estate investing and the aforementioned areas. Jark always has his finger on the pulse of the real estate industry and is well versed in contract law and technology. He has a penchant for continuing education and is extremely professional and pays great attention to detail. He is passionate about what he does and he genuinely cares for his clients and the people he works with. I look forward to a continued relationship with Jark and highly recommend him and his team to anyone needing a realtor when selling, buying or investing!","22 May, 2019",Donna Eng," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:38:28.060703,2021-06-17 15:38:30.928064,"Jark Krysinski *PREC, TeamYVR Real Estate Agents"
41,"Jark‚Äôs team helped me buy and sell a gorgeous townhome in Ladner! It was during those crazy time when purchasing a presale property had to have the luck of wining a lottery. So Jark and Olivia lined up four days and night in order to secure a good unit for me and other clients. I was impressed and moved. My unit is the best one and therefore at the time of resale, Jark and Olivia were able to sell it at the record price among all units in the same complex. But for their persistence, commitment and hard work, I wouldn‚Äôt have made such a good gain. Thank you Jark & Olivia! Please pick up a good investment property for me, and let‚Äôs do it again!","22 May, 2019",April Xu," Ladner, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:38:28.060703,2021-06-17 15:38:30.928064,"Jark Krysinski *PREC, TeamYVR Real Estate Agents"
42,"Jark Krysinski and his TeamYVR are professional and honest, and most importantly reliable real estate agents. They were referred to me through a few of their clients who are friends of mine. I was very happy to meet a non pushy realtor who patiently answered many questions about new pre-sales to me. When I received information early in the morning, I could feel how much Jark cares about his clients, and sharing the pros and cons with honesty, won my family's trust. We had a few very successful and profitable transactions and have come to consider him a part of the family. A few of my friends are going to buy their next family home in Vancouver West with Jark this spring, and I am sure they too will surely introduce him to their friends.","21 May, 2019",Ally Wu," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:38:28.060703,2021-06-17 15:38:30.928064,"Jark Krysinski *PREC, TeamYVR Real Estate Agents"
43,I've had the pleasure of getting to know and work with Jark this year and saying he is a remarkable person would truly be an understatement.

44,"I have worked with Jark and his team for more than 7 years. I refer him clients with confidence. During the past few years with very active market conditions I knew I could rely on his expertise to provide stellar service for my clients. He has a wide range of knowledge on property types, strata, investment properties and his contracts are well put together. Those things matter and separate him from other realtors.","21 May, 2019",Pauline Tonkin," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:38:28.060703,2021-06-17 15:38:30.928064,"Jark Krysinski *PREC, TeamYVR Real Estate Agents"
45,"Dear Jark, this is my fourth purchase with you. When I was buying investment properties I interviewed a lot of professionals. Your education, professionalism, and experience as an Investor was invaluable to me. We speak the same language. I say this even though I am from Korea and you are from Europe. The only difference is I am from Korea and have just been here for two years and you understood my objectives! Thank you for your patience and very hard work! Your loyal client, John.","21 May, 2019",James Shandon," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:38:28.060703,2021-06-17 15:38:30.928064,"Jark Krysinski *PREC, TeamYVR Real Estate Agents"
