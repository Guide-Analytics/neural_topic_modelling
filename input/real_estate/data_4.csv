0,The PRIME Real Estate team was fabulous to work with and made the entire process easy. Tony Joe is a true professional and ensured that the property transaction was completed seamlessly.,"25 May, 2021",Brenda Dayton," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
1,"Tony Joe and his team at Prime Real Estate are simply superb! I had been asked to initiate the long-distance sale of our family home. I'm in a different province, and turned to my award-winning local real estate agent to recommend someone in Victoria. Tony Joe and his team outshone others; his references are enduring and impeccable, and he answered emails/texts promptly. In doing my due diligence, I spoke at length with a comparable client he had recommended as a reference, I highly recommend this step, as it solidified his reputation with highly relevant detail. It was a no-brainer to recommend that my family deal with his team. Tony met and exceeded his superb reputation for ethics, emotional intelligence, professionalism, and attention to detail. For example, he noted an underground fuel tank that required examination prior to sale - something another agent had missed. He was finely attuned to the need to provide logistical support to my Victoria family, and take as much stress of their plate as possible. Hugely helpful - Tony's SWAT team of support professionals helped get the home ready. And by recommending a home inspection prior to sale, he also enabled potential buyers to make bids without conditions that could delay a sale. His data-driven approach was extremely helpful, without being overwhelming. For example, an efficiently presented and timely summary of other agents' comments on the property after initial viewing, helped our family understand market conditions, perception of the property, and appropriate pricing. His entry pricing also helped drive viewership to the property, and we sold quickly, and significantly above list price. Tony's process was designed to attract multiple offers, and he has the experience to support this approach. When doing your research, do ask agents what track record they have, such as how many multiple-offer sales they do in a month, and the list/asking ratio. Tony and his team have turned this multiple-offer process into an art and science that is truly impressive. His experience shows. It gave me HUGE peace of mind for my family to deal with a team of this caliber. It should be no surprise that Tony and his team generate substantial repeat business. I would not hesitate to do business with him again.","13 May, 2021",Grateful Customer,,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
2,"Extremely happy with Tony and his team. He helped me navigate a difficult sale given that I was out of the country due to Covid-19 restrictions during the sales process so everything had to be conducted remotely. I appreciated Prime's comprehensive marketing tools (floor plans, photography, 3D walk-through, online presence, social media posts, etc.), market assessment and pricing advice, help in preparing my property for viewing (cleaning, mechanical check, painting), pre-listing 'Coming Soon' awareness and connections within the industry to ensure maximum response. After only a few days on the market I received a full-price offer. Once accepted, Tony managed all the paperwork in a thorough and timely manner. A great experience all around!","10 May, 2021",George Allen," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

8,"Kyle was awesome. We were purchasing from Toronto and on two occasions Kyle took time to 1) show us around Sidney, BC and 2) show us a property via FaceTime.
Kyle was knowledgeable, informative, understanding, willing and above all patient. When you are buying out of town having someone that understands your needs are so important and Kyle was that person.
Kyle would answer all our questions with a quick response and if he didn't know the answer he told us and said he would get the answer.
We know that Kyle is only as strong as his team and we can say that the team Kyle works with is incredibly strong.","02 April, 2021",Neil Bennett,,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

10,"Tony Joe and the Prime Real Estate Team are exceptional. Tony has a wealth of experience and is the best in the business in Victoria. He listens very carefully and provides thoughtful information so that you can make an informed decision. Tony also hosts a talk show on CFAX 1070 that is super interesting and informative. He has access to an incredible array of people in all industries related to buying, selling and home ownership (across Canada and around the world). Tony is generous with his knowledge, time and has become a trusted friend over the years. His team, especially Lynnaya, are great. I highly recommend the Prime Team.","22 February, 2021",C Maier,,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

13,Kyle is the epitome of professionalism. He went above and beyond to look into future development in the area where I was purchasing after having listened to me express concerns about that in other areas where I was seeking homes. His response time was efficient and thorough. He went outside of his market area to look at homes with me and the transaction that transpired was seamless. I wish I had hired Kyle in the sale of my last home and would feel the utmost of confidence in using Kyle if I were ever to sell again. He's a true pro and a pleasure to work with.,"19 January, 2021",Linda Tesser," British Columbia, Canada",4.23,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
14,"In our dealings with Sean, right from the initial Zoom call, he was available and prompt with advice, ideas and information, particularly since we didn’t know a lot about the areas or the details of buying real estate in B.C. He was very professional in his dealings with us, the builders and their representatives. It was helpful that their office provided names of house inspectors, lawyers and mortgage brokers and after-sale information as well. We have been very pleased with our dealings with Sean and this office.","23 December, 2020",Steve Bivall," Saskatchewan, Canada",4.21,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

16,"My partner and I worked with Kyle to purchase our first home. He was wonderful to work with always friendly and willing to accommodate our schedule, if he wasn’t able to meet with us someone else from the team was always happy to meet with us so we didn’t potentially miss out on anything. Covid hit during our house search and he made sure we were still able to see what we wanted to and have every precaution taken that was necessary. Once our home was purchased the team made everything extremely simple and basic for us. We would highly recommend them to anyone :)","09 November, 2020",Jaimie Lingel,,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
17,"We loved working with Kyle Kerr to find our new home. From our first meeting we knew we wanted him on our side as we began the search for a new home. We were very impressed by his expansive knowledge of the market, his professionalism and his down to earth approach. He is genuine. Kyle also has a strong understanding of the various technical systems in homes such as heating, electrical and plumbing, It was extremely helpful to have that kind of knowledge when we were looking at potential homes.

18,"Tony Joe was exceptional. From our initial meeting with him we were so impressed with his industry knowledge, experience and professional manner. He handled the sale of our home during the challenging early days of Covid and ensured the needs of everyone involved, particularly the tenants, were met. He capably directed the entire process during the forced, extended close of the sale, which lasted several months, to a successful conclusion for all parties. Tony was always only a phone call or text message away and kept us informed at all times. If asked to refer a real estate professional, we would nominate Tony unequivocally.","03 October, 2020",Karen James, V8Z 3A2,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

20,"Kyle Kerr and Tony Joe exceeded every expectation we had of them. Kyle doesn't just possess extensive knowledge of neighbourhoods, future developments, amenities and bylaws, he has considerable knowledge of construction materials and building systems. This proved very useful to us in our purchase decision. Beyond that, both Tony and Kyle were great listeners; they understood what was important to us and this allowed them to guide us quickly to homes that were a great match to us. We felt that we were important and that finding our future home was important to them. They are authentic and ethical; we weren't just another commission to them, we were a relationship.

23,"[NOT_ACTIVATED_USER] I’ve known Tony for a few years now. He’s highly regarded in the community. He’s involved and shares his knowledge freely through his radio talk show on CFAX. He cares and he works hard. He has successfully sold two homes for me. In my most recent sale he had to navigate particularly challenging issues, not the least of which were the issues related to COVID. I also had tenants in place. Tony was extremely professional at all times. I can’t sing his praises loud enough. His 30 years experience was priceless. Tony Joe really earned his commission. Don’t ever underestimate the work that realtors do. Thank you Tony!","24 July, 2020",C Maier,,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

He and the team took us through the process seamlessly. I felt like every time i texted or called, I was responded to immediately, which I don't even know how that's possible.

31,"Kyle and his team made our move from another city a delight when it could easily have been a challenge. We were unfamiliar with the neighbourhoods and market dynamics, and learned quickly that good value properties went quickly. But we found a great home in a reasonable time at the right price, thanks to Kyle's expert guidance. Kyle was always quick to respond to and extremely patient with our many questions and concerns, and very proactive at helping us locate properties and navigate the house buying process. At every step he presented us with valuable information, including value analysis, home quality assessments, neighbourhood profiles, and trades and services who could help us with evaluating our purchase options.

35,"Tony Joe was referred to us by our Ladner real estate friend, to sell the Victoria half-duplex that got our daughter through her U.Vic days. We made the trip from the mainland to make the arrangements and say good-bye to our valued 4-year tenants who probably would've stayed for many more years, but we needed to begin simplifying and retiring. We liked Tony right away, for his charismatic, warm, friendly, welcoming, family guy, helpful, informative ways, thoroughly guiding us through every inch of the way, always answering promptly to any questions we had, which proposed a few challenges along the way. Listed in May, we had several failed offers because of the stringent prerequisites imposed onto prospective interested buyers by the banks.

She was extremely supportive during all the stages of the search and finally the purchase. Our son was the actual purchaser of his first home.

Highly recommended!","07 June, 2019",Mark Ottewell," Victoria, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
45,"People may think that because Prime Real Estate employs a different model - one agent helps you purchase your home while another agent sells yours - that this could naturally lead to communications challenges and jeopardize a seamless hand-off of files to you as the client. This assumption doesn't come close to the professionalism and continuity of care that the Prime Real Estate takes pride of their business model. This was so helpful to me when selling my home (Tony) and Angie helping me find the perfect location and a place that met my needs. The agents at Prime Real Estate and the front office staff take the time to get to know you, your needs and they serve with excellence!","30 May, 2019",ME Clark," Victoria, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
46,"Tony sold my mother-in-law's house a few years ago, and also his team had helped my brother-in-law find his house. I don't live in Victoria, and he kindly got rid of paint cans etc. that junk removal company wouldn't take. The house sale was quick and painless. Housing prices have gone down recently, which was disappointing, but I feel Tony set the correct price according to market conditions.","21 May, 2019",G.

47,"We used Kyle Kerr to buy our home in Victoria this past month. Needless to say he, and the whole PRIME Real Estate team, were outstanding.
Disclaimer: I have known Kyle for some time as we are friends from the same home town, however before choosing a real estate agent, I conducted a lot of research to see who would be the best choice based on the investment they make into selling the property (time and effort, not necessarily financially) and how they promote their listings. The PRIME Real Estate Team stood out as the best Victoria has to offer: their social media presence was strong, and I could tell they put a lot of work into their listings.
I've recommended the PRIME Real Estate Team to everyone I know. Kyle is a true professional and a genuine realtor; this means that he truly loves what he does. He has a great knowledge of the market, is patient, and ultimately finds joy in finding the perfect property for his clients. Real estate won't always be an easy process, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better Realtor than Kyle Kerr.","21 May, 2019",Sunny Hundle," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
48,"I decided to go with Tony for the sale of the property and as it turned out it was the best decision I could have made. There is very little I can add to the ratings that I gave him and his team. All along the process I received their full attention regarding every aspect of the undertaking. Tony kept me informed, kept me up to date along the way right up to the final steps of the sale of the property. Final words: complete satisfaction.","21 May, 2019",Steven Butz," Victoria, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
49,"Kyle Kerr came highly recommended by two friends and I’m glad I chose him to help me. Kyle was responsive, pro-active and very helpful in making my condo purchase a successful and comfortable experience. I can’t say enough about how great he was. He videotaped units and sent photographs and didn’t press me to make a purchase but instead provided insightful analyses for the condos I was considering. Because I live in Winnipeg, Kyle was my eyes, ears and nose on the ground for me and I’m so glad he was my agent!","21 May, 2019",Donna Everitt," Victoria, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

51,"I cannot overstate how pleased I am with every aspect of the selling process with this team. From market analysis to calculate realistic, accurate selling price, to advertising and promotion, including social media, print & online. Excellent photography services too. Tony and Kyle and Sonya and the whole team were courteous, thoughtful and truly wonderful to deal with. At no time did I ever feel lost within the team. Kyle got a record price for the unit size in our building, and 100% of asking. These are market experts and people experts. If you want the very best service contact Prime Team.","10 May, 2019",Life Time Customer,,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
52,"We were very happy with our experience with Kyle Kerr. He handled the purchase of our new home when we moved from the mainland. The purchase was a bit complicated as the sale of our home on the mainland, with another realtor, did not go smoothly so we had two separate negotiations for our new home. Kyle was there or over the phone every step of the way. When he could not be there in person due to previous commitments his colleague Angie Hill stepped in and was great. Thanks to Kyle and Angie!","07 May, 2019",Doug Woollard," Sidney, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

55,"The PRIME Real Estate Team exceeded our expectations. We worked most closely with Angie Hill who helped us navigate the complicated real estate market in Victoria, eventually leading to the purchase of our first home in a neighbourhood that we love. Angie's personality, determination and knowledge of the local market made us feel well-represented during the house hunting process. We highly recommend the team and will definitely use them again.","20 May, 2018",Andy Watson," British Columbia, Canada",4.71,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
56,Tony was recommended to us by the realtor who sold our home in Ontario. We emailed him and he got back to us right away. We explained what we were looking for and he told us about the state of the market in Victoria and what we should expect. Tony connected us with Angie who specializes in buying. She sent us updates on new listings and when we had questions about specific properties she was able to answer out questions and provide background information to help narrow our search. When we came to town she arranged to look at some homes the day we arrived and we ended up putting in an offer the same day. Throughout the process Angie and Tony provided good advice and looked out for our needs. I will recommend them to anyone buying a house in Victoria.,"20 April, 2018",Bill H," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
57,Tony and his team helped negotiate a seamless real estate transaction. There was no drama or confusion. The sale was fast and efficient. There were no incompetent plunders in the sales contract on Tony's side... no surprises when the conveyancing took place!! Tony did exactly what he said he could do and that means everything to me. I will definitely hire Tony and his team again when I need to engage a realtor. They even sent me a birthday card and a hand written thank you card. I feel like a valued customer and for that I am all the more grateful.,"12 April, 2018",C Maier," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team

62,"Tony was recommended to me by a friend in Victoria as one of the top agents. He was very friendly on first meeting, and I felt he was very knowledgeable about the current market conditions. He was spot on the timing to list the property, arranged a number of open houses to accommodate clients, and his marketing program was obviously very good as potential buyers came from Vancouver. I also liked that I could access his website and go to my property to see comments on what clients thought, how many were attending the open houses, and follow-up steps required. He handled the closing very well, maximizing the number of offers. He also handled my tenants very well, was considerate of their needs, and kept them in the loop for the open houses. Highly recommend him.","18 January, 2017",Glenna Urbshadt," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
63,"As a senior with some health challenges, I was given excellent, considerate, caring help that went above and beyond. The entire team was on my side in every way possible,
I have bought and sold a few times in the past so am able to compare and contrast. This experience provided the specific expertise that I valued and needed in the current hot market.
I can certainly recommend Tony Joe and his team with no reservations!!","13 January, 2017",CJ DOUGLAS, V8V 1M8,5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
64,"Thrilled to have an opportunity to endorse the many positive skills and attributes that Tony Joe brings to buyers, sellers, Victoria and real estate in general. Tony and his dedicated team are fantastic and I have no doubt as a recent seller that Tony could help anyone!
Tony was always timely, patient, fair and realistic when ever we discussed the sale of my property. My property was a hard house to sell and two other local realtors prior to Tony had failed. Tony's positive energy, can do attitude, and thorough approach to advertising contributed to the positive outcome.
Without a doubt I would use Tony Joe again! I will continue to refer family, friends and colleagues his way. I am positive that others will have similar excellent experiences.","13 January, 2017",Pamela Richards," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
65,"As a former resident of Victoria returning after a lengthy absence, I found Tony knowledgeable and forthcoming with relevant market information on an area of the city with which I was unfamiliar. He provided valuable learning for me on a life lease arrangement for a property I was considering and ultimately purchased. In addition, Tony's knowledge of services offered in the community, including church, banking, shopping, insurance, tradespeople and professionals provided me with a measure of comfort and sense of belonging even before moving in.
Tony and his staff went the extra mile with personal, practical and professional support in making my recent purchase in Oak Bay. I have also learned the high regard in which he is held by the community and the real estate industry. I would not hesitate to call on him again in any future real estate transaction.","13 January, 2017",Carol McMehen," Victoria, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 10:48:47.252001,2021-06-17 10:48:50.025278,PRIME Real Estate Team
