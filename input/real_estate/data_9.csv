He had answered all my questions regarding the real-estate market: trends, pricing in near-by neighborhoods, rental prices, many more.He was always punctual. He had answer my many phone calls any time of day (once even @ 11:pm).

1,"Karson is a true professional. Beyond being competent, detail-oriented, tech-savvy, and aware of the market trends, he offers an exceptional level of service. As a first-time home buyer, I was made to feel fully confident and well-equipped to view potential homes, understand my options as a buyer, and get a feel for what was a fair price. Karson went the extra mile to schedule viewings that worked for my schedule, get info from the seller's agent to pre-screen homes before making an appointment, and dug up recent home sales history in the same area that I was looking in, to do a price comparison for value.
He was also my advocate when liaising with the seller's agent, and kept track of many details for my sake. Absolutely recommend Karson.","17 April, 2021",Larissa Huang," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong
2,Karson was extremely professional and helpful in helping us find a new home in this difficult market. He has a great understanding of the market and provided a lot of recommendations that we were not aware of. I would definitely ask for his service again.,"14 April, 2021",Felix Li," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong
3,Karson was great at helping us find our new home. He was always fast to reply and he was always very patient with us. I also appreciated his feedback and suggestions as he concerns to our attention that may not be apparent right away. Karson is also willing to go above and beyond when needed to such as booking us last minute viewings and researching trends in the market.

4,"We previously worked with Karson in 2016 for the sale of our condo and purchase of a townhouse and his professionalism, honesty and work ethic is why we went with him again to sell our current townhouse and purchase our current home. What's great about Karson is that when we want to get emotional about things he is chill and not in a bad way. He loves the numbers - what was sold in your area, for how much, who asked for too much, etc. all to determine the likely value your home would sell for - but he also works with your requests. So in that essence he uses his own knowhow with your goals to make it a real team effort. He assembled excellent photography, 3D tour of the home, a video, and got these out all over the internet, and the fact that we had 20 showings during the pandemic on the weekend demonstrated the time and effort he put in to get our place out there. Karson works until the deal is done. Where I would see other agents clearly cut corners on things, Karson is a closer - he sees things through to the end. As a result, because he did the work to see what other homes like ours were selling in the area, we were able to apply that info to guide our offer on our home and got a fair price on the home we purchased. He attended the home inspection of our new place to ensure it went smoothly - above and beyond stuff. I would absolutely recommend Karson - with so many agents to choose from, it's nice to know this one will work for you.","14 April, 2021",Curious George," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong

8,"I knew Karson from a recommendation of a friend. I chose Karson as my realtor as his assistant, who is Korean, could help me with better translation and understanding, and ultimately as Karson previously dealt complicated real-estate problem successfully from a friend of mine. It was the first time purchasing, which made things a little confusing and complicated in the beginning, but fortunately Karson was able to walkthrough the process step by step, with a level of detail I appreciated. Karson Wong is a very professional real estate agent. He doesn't hesitate to help his client at the time that is most convenient and needed, and willingly reaches out further to give extra helpful information that is beneficial to acknowledge. During the meetings he always take a moment to give you chance to ask any question that comes to mind or remind any details that are good to know. What I appreciated about dealing with Karson was that he is thorough. There was one time he brought a Gopro camera during the inspection to record all the details that happened during the inspection, and later sent video link. It was helpful as those are easily forgettable. I would recommend Karson's services to my friend or anyone that is looking to involve in real-estate dealing. If you feel like your experience or knowledge in real-estate is not as good, especially for first time buyers like myself, you will appreciate the level of detail that he will go through to ensure that you meet your expectation.","13 November, 2020",Anna Lee,,5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong
9,"Karson is a diligent and a punctual thorough professional. I met Karson through a common friend (who is a realtor in Calgary) while I was looking to buy a new home in Vancouver Area. I knew the area that I wanted to buy a property. In our first meeting, which, due to COVID, was a telephonic one, I explained Karson what exactly we (my wife and I) were looking for. Karson regularly sent us details of the properties that matched our requirements, till we found the one that we loved. During this time, he helped us look at multiple properties and with every 'showing' he was able to understand our requirements better. During the final transactions, we were out of town. He liaised with the home inspector and got the home inspection done and then held a live video conference to let us know the result. He made a video of entire home inspection and then sent it to us. He went above and beyond to ensure that our absence did not impact our decision. Karson is a trustworthy and reliable realtor who works in the interest of his clients. I recommend him to anyone who is looking to buy a property in Vancouver Area, especially if you are busy and can not run around to do the leg work. Overall, I would rate him 10/10.","08 November, 2020",Bandhul Mishra,,5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong

11,"May 16th 2015 Yaletown condo selling review
It is very exciting and honored to have this great opportunity of leaving a positive review for our hard working, smart, and experienced real estate agent, Karson Wong. We had started our relationship as a agent and clients on May in 2015. My wife and I had an initial meeting with Karson and he prepared very detailed and professional presentation for us to have better understanding of market status, value of our property, and how buying/selling works. After the meeting, my wife and I had decided to work with Karson. One of the biggest reasons why we had chosen Karson was because Karson was not 'forcing' his strategies to us like other agents did. My wife and I had met and talked with few other agents before we met Karson, even some of the agents were rude and ignoring our expectations. Where as Karson, he fully understood and accomodated with our situations and needs. During the negotiating time, he had stayed with us until very late night for us to get as perfect as possible deal.
We were deeply impressed with his passion and professionalism as a real estate agent and showed us how and what the real customer service supposed to be.
After he helped us for selling our yaletown condo, we had a chance to strongly recommend Karson to our friend family, and they were also completely amazed by professional skills and attitude of Karson Wong. Hopefully more and more people have same chance of working with Karson like we did for selling and buying properties.
There will be absolutely no regret. Thank you.","24 July, 2020",Denny Park," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong

13,"Karson was very punctual and made time to meet our schedule. He provided us with a booklet of all the similar buildings which had been sold in the last couple years.

15,"I had two experiences to buy a presale condo with him. He is so kind and meticulous. The most important things when people buy a home are actual informations such as price change, investment potential, the value of the home, appropriate size of my life style and the convenience in real estate market. He has enough informations and good opinion for each customer. When customer has some concerns, he advices on it with actual, proper and detailed solution. He is also responsible person so he takes care of all when it may happen after contract. That's why I had already recommended him to my friends to buy and sell a home. One of my friend is so meticulous and a little strict person. He is satisfied with all proceeds with him. His family are willing to proceed with next opportunity. One of his merit is language. He can cover other languages such as Chinese and Korean.","05 May, 2020",Hyun Mi Kim," British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong

19,"Being an owner of various properties in the lower mainland. I have worked with a number of Realtors across different companies. Working with Karson from Remax was a great experience for my last purchase. He was by far the most attentive to details and efficient to work with, and always a phone call away to my needs. While I considered myself an experienced owner and investor, I always appreciate Karson’s tips and knowledge throughout the entire experience of the purchase. I think being a successful realtor not only means able to sell and close your sale, but really understand the clients’ needs and able to offer exceptional service through the whole purchasing journey.

Being a first time home buyer (with a limited budget) in a competitive Vancouver real estate market, I was intimidated to start my home buying process.

What I appreciated the most was that he always responsive to emails, text and phone calls and made time for you even on the weekends and late in the evening. Furthermore, his knowledge of the local housing market and houses/condos in general is top notch. From the start, I could tell that his best interest was to help me find a home that would match my budget and personal needs.

Being a overseas purchaser, i was impossible for me to be present to visit the open houses. However, Karson would visit open houses for us along with taking video recordings of the house as well as videos of the surroundings of the buildings and roads. Also, Karson would give professional advices on pricing as he is familiar with different prices in different areas( Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Richmond, White Rock.). I choose Karson as my realtor because I trust him as a professional. He is responsible and he would give advices based on the fundamentals of investments and weighting out the pros and cons of each investment.

Drove us to a number of open houses at the beginning, and helped us come to a reasonable decision given the price range and location we were considering. Eventually, it was clear to us what type of place (e.g., sq ft, room number, which floor) would be good for us, and Karson was able to inform all the details about the places we were interested in. Ultimately, no matter which agent you use, buyer need to make a decision about what he really wants, rank his priorities accordingly, and most importantly, should verify all the recommendations from multiple sources. First-time buyers are not generally aware of this process, and that’s where an agent can help. Karson helped us come to that decision and explained the process well, responded to my requests quickly, recommended suitable services (e.g., home inspection, bank), assigned a different agent for a situation when he could not be available, had a good understanding with the seller's agent, and suggestions were constructive and helpful.

From the beginning of the process, through to completing the sale, his knowledgeable and professional approach made the process of buying our first home a smooth one.
Karson's real estate understanding is comprehensive, from larger market trends, to financing, to neighborhood values, right down to the pros and cons of different building materials. There wasn't a question that I threw at him, that he couldn't answer with thoughtful and helpful information.
Buying a first home, especially in a very hot market like the Lower Mainland of B.C., can be a stressful and daunting experience. Working with Karson helped to relieve a lot of that stress, and give us a great deal of confidence and assurance.
I am happy to report that with Karson's help, we found a home that we love, in the area that we wanted, that checks all of our boxes.
I will certainly turn to Karson in future if and when I am again in need of an agent to help buy or sell a home.
