He guided us through every step of the process and we always felt like we were in the best hands.  Ben worked tirelessly to help us a find our perfect home for an amazing price.  He would always take initiative to assure we never missed out on a viewing or a timely inspection.  He also had nice touches like his welcome package, his thoughtful emails, his prompt responses, and his pain free way of dealing with documents. I would highly recommend Ben to anyone looking for a home. He is the best!",

Ben is incredibly professional, immensely warm and kind. He took the time to really get to know us and our evolving search criteria as we navigated a very challenging market. He was thoughtful, patient and extremely detail orientated. He is profoundly knowledgable and you could easily tell he was well respected amongst fellow real estate colleagues.\n\nHe never missed a beat and was so thorough always including every detail. Ben was always 100% transparent with us, which is something I found truly invaluable because I knew he would always provide us honesty. He is prompt and very timely. He created a safe space for us to feel we could contact him at any point with any questions. He always made us feel validated and immediately addressed any concerns we were having.\n\nHe truly went above and beyond to find us our amazing home. Ben worked tirelessly and did absolutely everything beyond just the sale of the house itself to make us feel so confident and happy with our purchase. His emails were my favourite thing to receive always. They were so well put together and easy to understand and follow. He truly walks you through the house buying experience from start to finish and I have nothing but AMAZING things to say about Ben.\n\nWe have already recommended him to all our friends and family and would HIGHLY recommend him without a doubt to anyone wishing to sell/purchase a home. He's the absolute best and we cannot wait to work with him again in the future.",

We found this to be a perfect combination. At all times he was responsive and available when we needed him, and we found the eventual buying process to be swift, focused, and professional.\n\nSteve Bridgewater",

I felt no pressure to list. When the condo was listed he was thoughtful and courteous when dealing with my daughter and her family who were living there.  The condo sold within a week due in good part to Ben's realistic pricing and thorough preparation. He has been a pleasure to work with and I will have no problem recommending his services or engaging him again should the need arise.",

And hard work it is for all!\nI have had the pleasure of dealing with Ben (long-distance) for the past 7- months.  During the entire process, and now yours,  I can guarantee he will be at your side guiding you every step of the way with his patience, his daily emails with his hand-picked listings to suit you, and never failing to answer a query day or night.  Ultimately, my Vancouver Island raised husband Mike,  and I,  acquired a beautiful condo for our retirement in a few years.\nI think what really makes Ben stand out is his unbridled drive and enthusiasm along with his determination in making sure we had the right  condo, mortgage broker,  insurance provider, lawyer and rental agent to finish off the job without a hitch.  And just to mention, maybe most importantly,  he makes it obvious that he loves  what he does.  Thank you again Ben.  Best Regards,  Marlene and Mike, 03/14/16",

But a few minutes with him made us realize that he's exactly what we needed - knowledgable, connected, persistent, but never pushy, and wise beyond his age. After 7 months of looking for our perfect condo, we finally found the one that fit us the best. And through this process Ben was there to educate, to listen, and to guide. He took his time with us and never rushed - always provided detailed explanations to any question we had - from basic to the really complex. He is very meticulous in going through all the strata paperwork, which I can't say about many other realtors - Ben saved us a huge headache in potentially purchasing a condo in a building with a hidden structural problem. With Ben it's never about earning a commission - we knew that he had our best interest in mind at all times, even if it meant withdrawing our bid. Our experience with Ben was above and beyond what we expected, and he made our dream of owning our home a reality! Forever grateful!",

      "text": "This company was great until there was issues between the neighbors. The lack of response from the manager has led the issues to escalate. Normally I don't go out of my way to write bad reviews but I feel I should share my experience here, as I often look to reviews myself and I had read the reviews on Advent before renting from them and liked what I saw. Also before I go further, I will expect to get a reply saying \"call the office\" or denying that there are any issues, as has come with all the other negative reviews on here. I am renting a basement suite from them on a property that has another basement suite , a laneway and a four bedroom space upstairs.\nThe complaints my neighbors and I have had had been fair requests that were outlined in our agreement. There's been an unreasonable amount of noise all through the night from other tenants, garbage in our yard and the alley that has been left by them, not to mention a few weeks of dog poop left in our section of the yard when they have a full front yard to themselves. The sound and garbage issues have been happening for over 2 months.\nThese issues have been brought to advent's notice time and time again and it gets pushed off with comments such as \"I've left a voicemail with the other tenants\", even ignoring of texts and emails from more than one person. It's a shame because it has been fine otherwise. I would recommend them if you're sure you will have no problems of respecting parts of your contract from other neighbors or any sort of disrespect. Otherwise, it's upsetting and frustrating how they push the issue around, I'm assuming that they're expecting us to give up. I don't appreciate being woken up by other neighbors multiple nights and by their smoke alarms going off and taking my recycling out to find all sorts of garbage just dumped out there and blown around the yard. As mentioned, if the issues had been properly taken care of and there was some sort of enforcement of management with Advent, I don't think these would have escalated. This morning our power was out because Advent didn't care to discuss the change with BC Hydro when they took over the property and I missed an important meeting and as a result lost money.\nAgain I don't like to go out of my way to write such negative reviews, but I wanted to share this information as I feel such disrespect and lack of care from Advent. It could be our assigned property manager specifically, but in that case it reflects on the company.\nPeace.\n\n**RESPONSE TO OWNER'S REPLY BELOW**\nThank you for the thorough reply.\nA few items to consider, I am aware that smoke alarms are for safety. The smoke alarms were going off at 4am, 3am, mine were replaced recently so I assume it was due to being wired to the ones upstairs.\nJason told me that one notice was sent, and he had told me that information after this review was posted that it was sent a few days ago.\nThe garbage has been blown around in the yard, there was a bag left in front of my front door, plastic all in the compost multiple times. I was not notified that a new bin was ordered and I'm glad to hear it. Although there could be a millions trash cans added it won't help the lack of sorting, the general mess and the garbage left around the lane and our yard by the other tenants.\n\n\"Efficiently\" is one way to put your response time as the loud noises and garbage has been happening since beginning February 2021.\nI have no reason to take time to write this review if it wasn't true. I am frustrated with the lack of care from Advent and this is why I'm sharing.",

The majority of companies I contacted, didn't call back or took days to get back to me? When they got back to me, the interactions didn't inspire confidence.\n\nAfter calling 7 companies, I called Advent. Within a day, I spoke to a friendly secretary. She addressed my needs and after, connected me to Jason Wong. From the first call, I noticed he was knowledgeable and an effective listener. He plugged the right questions when needed, giving good advice. During our first face to face meeting, Jason was pro!Efficient with time management, he wasted no time. He handled taking photos, posting the listing promptly, handling tenant screenings, and  going on site for tenant viewings. After each viewing, Jason called to report how it went. After a few viewing we setup a meeting with two interested parties. After followup and approval we moved forward to with a 1 year lease.\n\nBiggest thing for me is Jason  Understood my tight deadline to rent, due to leaving the country. He went the extra mile finding me and excellent tenants in the 11th hour! 👏\n\nIt been a year plus and I'm very happy with how everything turned out. It worked out so well I referred Jason to my business partners who had the same excellent experience.",

      "text": "I have left a lot of google reviews in the past but none like this where I feel an obligation to share my experience with Advent as a warning to others. As a property owner who was shopping around for property management companies to hand off my property to, I found Advent to be very unprofessional and rude. They also tried to convince me to be willing to rent my place out for much less than what it is worth. From scrolling through other people’s reviews, I notice the owner responds to most negative comments with either telling people to ignore the defamation or that the reviewer does not exist in their system; hence, I am providing a very detailed review of my personal interactions with Advent.\n\nI have a 1 bedroom + den (650 sqft) around Broadway/Commercial that I was looking to rent out and was considering handing it over to a property management company. I spoke with an Advent employee in Business Development at the end of Aug-2020 (I have records of who it was but I will not name her in this review). The conversation started out fine, until I asked how much she thinks my apartment can be rented out for. She said they usually do not provide this information without taking a look at the place first. I told her one of my deciding factors of whether I want to hand it off to a property management company was how much they might list it for because an assessor from the bank had given me a rental estimate. She asked how much it was assessed at and when I responded with $2100, she suddenly got very hostile and aggressive, saying I will not get more than $1700-800 for my apartment. She said she is quite annoyed because assessors should not be giving clients false information and false expectations because it makes her job harder and that the assessors do not know what they are doing and are not licensed like she is. She went on to say that for $2100, people can get a similar place in downtown so why would anyone want to rent around Broadway/Commercial when they can be in downtown (for someone that keeps mentioning they are licensed and is an expert in this field, she did not seem to realize not everyone wanted to live downtown). She went on to ask how they came up with such an absurd number and I said the assessor pulled rental ads from nearby similar properties and that the 1 bedroom in the rental building next to mines has it listed up to $2300. She got more agitated and ranted about how that is not the proper way to set a rental price. She continued to tell me $2100 was an unreasonable ask by saying the brand new low rise nearby (name The Victoria) has 1 bedrooms for $1800 and asked why would people pay more for something that is similar to mine but is brand new. She then went on to pull up the rental listings at The Victoria to try to prove her point …  I did as well and we saw that for $1800, it was a 450 sqft studio she was trying to compare mines to. At that point, I felt like I was talking to a novice with a poor attitude so I thanked her for her time and hung up. While shopping around for a property management company, I posted my apartment for the $2100 and had multiple applications for it. I ended up renting it out at $2100 within 2 weeks of this incident. Most other property management companies I spoke to said my place can rent for $2100-2300 and were very professional. I personally would have gone with Birds Nest Properties if I didn’t find a tenant by Oct. I highly recommend all owners to get an idea of what their rental property can go for before speaking to Advent because my feeling of them is that they are a volume business and their goal is to rent out your place as quickly as possible so they can start collecting the 8% monthly fee and that they do not care about getting the best rent they can for the owners. A $300 difference in rent is ~$300 more for the owners, but 8% of $300 is just $24 more for them.",

After contacting the landlord to see what we could improve, the landlord informed us the agency had denied the application.

I truly believe the application was great and the apartment was a great fit for the landlord and for us.

      "text": "My partner and I contacted Advent about viewing an apartment. For the first one we confirmed the viewing but the property manager missed our email while they were away on holidays, understandable. So we rebooked for later in the day, and everything was great. The second apartment viewing was rescheduled due to snow, again understandable. However the property manager never contacted us to reschedule despite multiple emails from both myself and my partner. Finally the third apartment viewing was booked and confirmed, but the property manager never showed up. I waited for 45 minutes, called them, texted them, and emailed them but received no reply. I called the office to speak to a manager, was told that they would look into it and get back to us, but have yet to hear back from them 2 weeks later. I understand that tenants aren't their clients, especially in Vancouver's competitive rental climate where tenants are often dismissed, but failing to show up and not following up is very unprofessional. We have found better luck with more responsive property management companies and will be reluctant to trust Advent moving forward.\n\nEdit: The property manager followed up apologizing for the misunderstandings, and mentioned new options for rentals available, but at this point my partner and I had found an apartment. I'm leaving this review up as is because while they had contacted me to rectify the situation, it was too late at that point and it does not address the previous experience with them.",

I got back to her right away and provided 3 different times/day the week following that worked for meeting her at the building. I work from home, so my timing is quite flexible. It took her 2 days to reply back and when she got back to me, she wrote: \"Thanks for getting back to me, are you available for a showing on Tuesday December 11th at 12:15pm? I realize this is outside of your preferred showing times but I must comply with the current tenant’s requests and their personal schedule too.\"\nOkay, I understand this point but then why bother to ask me my preferred times if it didn't really matter?\n\nAs it turned out, the timing she proposed interfered with a client meeting and when I inquired if any of the other times I offered worked, she never bothered to reply back. Brutal.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I noticed the unit was still available so again I reached out. The reply: \"We have just received applications for tenancy on this unit. Should they not be approved I can contact you back to arrange a viewing. Please note that I will be away from the office from Dec 22-30, so showings after this week will recommence in the new year.\"\nWhatever. I never heard from her again and have moved on.\n\nI've owned many businesses in my career. If any of my employees treated a potential customer like this, I would seriously have to consider whether they should be employed with the company.\n\nI would never recommend Advent to anyone. Lousy response time and lousy service.\n\nLook elsewhere.",

The office person I spoke to was helpful that's why I'm giving 2 stars here. I work in healthcare, I can hardly take lunch breaks. I think its preposterous to not accommodate potential rental customers with showing timings, especially who are genuinely Interested.\n\nUpdate: commenting on the reply of this agency, this place I was interested in, is a brand new rental called Ridgewood place. There were NO PREVIOUS TENANTS. Please stop covering for the incompetence of your rental agents and review them to not have them\ndo this to someone else. Please donot fabricate responses that are not reviewed without proof.\n\nUpdate: Business deleted their comment.",

I didn't get a response back for the first inquiry so I contacted Liz again. She responded with a longggg application to be filled prior to the viewing. We're not talking about a few questions to filter people, it was a tenancy application. I called her to say we don't even know if we like the place so why are we sharing all of these sensitive information with you and she never returned the call. In fact on the voice message they very directly say that if you leave a voice message they won't call you back!! We ended up finding another apartment. I would never get these guys to list my property. The unit we wanted to look at was listed for almost 2 months and they even dropped the price but we couldn't even go see it. In our apartment search we came across many rental companies and they all went out of their way to accommodate a time that would work for us and actually tried to sell the place. Maybe these guys are too busy and don't have the time to show their apartments, I don't know, but whatever the reason it's pretty hard to rent out a place if you're not willing to show it.",

I enjoyed working with this Vancouver property manager and would recommend.",

The team is so enthusiastic and hard-working, and I'm so grateful for how they have gone out of their way to help me, in so many ways.

He sent me e-copies of the lease to sign, answered all my questions quickly despite the three hour time change and was flexible in meeting with my friend to hand over the keys prior to my arrival.\n\nDuring the time that I was renting the unit, he was responsive whenever I needed anything and maintained a kind and positive attitude in all of our encounters.",

He was doing first-come-first served and not enforcing 15 minute limits. We were told we had to wait at least half an hour, and there was nothing he could do. I asked around and it turns out he had other people booked into the same time slot, and he made zero effort to get us in. This is during COVID so it's illegal to have multiple parties in the home at once. Basically violating real estate board rules by treating it like a standard open house, and didn't care because he had a yard full of prospective buyers. We've been to 27 showings and never been treated so poorly.",

      "text": "I do not recommend buyers viewing these agent’s listings.  It can be a frustrating  waste of time for a prospective buyer.  Based on my review of two listed properties in Surrey, it is my opinion Nu Stream uses a system for selling real estate that is not making the market efficient and seems unethical.\nThey use a property’s list asking price as an invitation to make an offer, which is legal,  but the list asking price has no close relation to the actual selling price.   It reminds me of the travel agents practice of  listing  really cheap flights to entice you then adding on another  200% for taxes.\nTheses agent will advise the seller to list the property unrealistically below fair market value to get many potential real estate buyers interested in the property despite the seller having no real intention of selling at that price.\nThese agents will also arrange open houses for short periods of time and limited hours  where customers are rushed through the property in 3 minutes with others lined up out front to make the home look popular in order to create a false sense of interest in the property.\nThese agents will present all offers to the seller as an indication of their market prowess, but the seller will never counter-offer or will counter-offer with a price many tens of thousands higher than the listed asking price.   This method wastes the buyer’s time and fosters distrust in the market. To me this is not making the market efficient, it is creating a pricing uncertainty about the market and has the potential to foster and fuel further  unethical practice among realtors who must compete.\n\nFurther to my comments,  I was informed it is the Real Estate Council of BC ‘s policy that, the seller has ultimate control of this market strategy and it is beyond the jurisdiction of real estate council scope to police its members in regards to this strategy.",

The issue is that the realtor fee was discussed already before, but when it was time for payment, they requested an additional $10,000 that was never discussed in the deal. They used trickery and deceptive words saying that our deal was not concise and confusing. HOWEVER, everything was explained very detailed. Unfortunately, Google does not allow me to give 0 stars, because trust me, they deserve a negative rating. To go more into detail, Ken Cui is utterly and completely disgusting, rude, arrogant, harsh, and blunt. He has no idea how to treat his clients politely and has engaged in multiple arguments with me and all of them were started by him and his repulsive attitude. I hope this review helps and you are not fooled to use this realtor company.",

He would've had more than enough time to listen to the VM before calling me from how long it took him to call me back. I wouldn't know which realtor is calling me back about which property as I'm looking at many listings so I purposely leave detailed messages. On top of that, he started speaking in language I didn't understand. I asked him I don't understand what he's saying IN ENGLISH. He was so STUPID enough to continue talking in his language!!!! Like how can someone be so incompetent?! He eventually spoke English but the attitude was the worst!!! I will never use this company for this reason.

Amir worked with us to understand our budget and needs and took the time to educate us every step of the process. He showed us over 30 homes in five weeks in 3 different neighbourhoods. We could not be happier with the home we purchased or with our experience working with Amir. We would have never found our home without him and it has the best view in town!",

They then gave me a video tour and described the entire process of rental in Vancouver to me in detail. Not only did they explain it to me, they became my point person as I was waiting for employment verification, guarantor verification, etc. If it were not for them, I would never have gotten my apartment. They communicated with the leasing office for me and took care of all the complexities so I could focus on my family and my career. They have my highest recommendation and endorsement.

She is a kind and considerate realtor who takes the time to really ensure you understand every piece of minutia that goes into finding your new home. She is supremely organized and was extremely proactive in helping us navigate the cycle. Her connections provided us with many options for notaries, lawyers, and insurance agents - all of whom were good people who had our best interests in mind versus trying to make a quick buck.\n\nNancy can be relied upon to give candid and realistic advice. With the pandemic going on, she setup numerous web calls with us to guide us through the paperwork and procedure (even late at night!), and she was extremely patient with us. When it was permitted by health regulations, she was there in person as much as possible. She listens hard and goes above and beyond to ensure that us, and hopefully you also, are beyond satisfied.\n\nIn summary, Nancy is the prime example of a realtor that truly has your back throughout your home buying journey. Whether it be early on in the process, identifying your needs/wants and sending you listings that match what you are looking for, or on the day you close and take possession, Nancy is there to provide you with the professional advice and attention to detail that makes the buyer experience so much easier. She works hard for you, and fights for you. I would not for a second hesitate to recommend her.",

Her patience and understanding allowed us to relax because we knew we could put our full trust in her expertise and advice, and she delivered over and above expectations. Nancy kept us updated on every aspect in a timely, professional manner and worked hard on our behalf. She made what at first seemed to be something totally overwhelming to us much much less complicated. The whole process from listing to closing felt smooth and seamless and she proved over and over that our trust was not misplaced. Nancy, you're a star! We are so grateful and can't thank you enough! We'll definitely be recommending you to anyone buying or selling property!",

Or read on to find out more about my experience with her.\n\nI was in the process of purchasing a home from abroad and I could not have done it without Nancy. The combination of being out of the country and the current pandemic could have made this whole process so complicated and stressful - and it was, UNTIL I found Nancy! She is a fantastic realtor and a truly lovely human being.\n\nWe had a wonderful initial conversation where she really listened to what I was looking for and followed up by sending me the most perfectly-matched homes. She is extremely organized. She got right on it when I found one by getting in there and taking PERFECT videos of the property for me. She is so thorough. She took the initiative to also send me videos of another property that she came across that was an even better fit and much nicer and still within my price range - it's the home I ended up purchasing! She was so helpful throughout the entire process. She is very responsive, always on her phone and email. Another one of her many strengths is that she made certain I was comfortable and clear with everything and always made herself available to chat, answer questions or go over documents. She was so flexible and considerate of my busy schedule and did exactly what she said she would do with everything. She is incredibly focused and hardworking which made this process so smooth and my life much easier. Now you may be thinking, okay, she is lovely and considerate and communicative and very pleasant to work with, but can she negotiate price? The answer is 100% YES. When it came to this point, she really made sure I was not overpaying a penny which is what you want when you're making a purchase of any kind.\n\nTo sum it up, Nancy is hard-working yet patient, incredibly intelligent yet she has no arrogance or ego, and she is so considerate, respectful and pleasant yet she's a completely strong, powerhouse boss babe who doesn't waste anyone's time. This gives me the confidence to say that whether you are purchasing for personal or investment, or selling a property, Nancy Che is your gal. I will definitely be working with her again in the future.",

Amir is an excellent agent with a friendly attitude and professional behavior, always smile on the face but serious in the procedures.\nSelling and buying a house/condo is a stressful job for everyone and especially time-sensitive in the Vancouver market. From my standpoint, having an agent beside you to genuinely contribute in your thought process, be responsive day and night, have a sense of urgency when it comes to closing the deal, being forthright, share his honest recommendations, and being a good listener are the attributes of an ideal realtor which I think Amir has all these qualities. Sometimes people's life-savings money is in the realtors' hands, and if they are not honest and trustworthy, then a significant financial loss will be inevitable. In this industry, we need more of him and his team to boost morale and trust.\nHe was busy but extremely communicative and easy to reach to answer any of our questions at all times. I highly recommend him.",

Amir is straight forward and very honest, as well as being a terrific person. He works very, very hard for you and I can not say enough good things about him and his staff. Not only would I recommend him - I would say that you are doing yourself a disservice if you didn't at least talk to him when selling your house. Absolutely first class operator and good human being.",

I was unable to locate my mail box keys and he replaced them for me at no cost after the deal was closed. Overall, I can say with confidence he was the best realtor I have come across in my 25 years of living in Vancouver.\nHe is highly recommend and will definitely do business with him in the future.",

I have never met a real estate agent that is so efficient in his work and listened to all my concerns. I was so lucky to find Amir, he wasn't pushy and actually let me take my time seeing all the options and didn't pressure me to buy. He was so energetic and he made me feel so comfortable in texting him at any time, it was like talking to a long time friend! I recommend Amir to anyone looking for a place in Vancouver, you will not find a more trustworthy agent than him. He has a genuine passion for real estate, you will never be disappointed working with him.",

He is not only experienced in North and West Vancouver, but also respected by other realtors finding him very professional, and count on his words.\nAt the end he has closed a very good deal for me, together with his strong team of finance, mortgage, inspectors etc.\nI will definitely go to him for next time, as a buyer or seller.

He is a great communicator and always made sure that I understood what I needed to do to purchase the property, while keeping me informed with progress as it happened. He consistently  provided me with prompt replies and took the time to answer any of the questions that I had.

When we started talking about selling our apartment (in the middle of a pandemic no less!) we had a great chat with Dimitri and started sketching out a game plan. From the very beginning, Dimitri’s experience and knowledge of the market brought an ease and confidence to the process, and that was invaluable. In a time of relative uncertainty, he gave us the assurance we needed to stay poised and patient and that is certainly what made the difference.\n\nDimitri is a professional in every aspect.\n\nStaging, photos, videos and marketing? He knows the little tweaks that had our place looking amazing.\n\nScheduling, logistics and communication? Dimitri was super fast to respond at all times and is a very clear communicator.\n\nManaging expectations and emotions? He’s been in virtually every situation many times before and that experience creates so much ease and confidence.\n\nWhen it came time to field offers and negotiate, Dimitri had the correct advice. He navigated everything in a way that had everyone feeling comfortable and happy.\n\nAnd, of course, you can’t really talk about Dimitri without mentioning what a genuinely good person he is. He’s just nice to be around.\n\nWe would not hesitate to recommend Dimitri to anyone at anytime.\n\nThank you so much, again, Dimitri! You made a potentially stressful process so straightforward and logical. Cheers!",

He takes the time not only to understand  and take care of a client’s real estate needs but also to understand the person and to make a personal connection, facilitating easy communication and successful business interactions at the same time.  He sincerely cares about his clients. He has a vast wealth of knowledge, and his advice is invaluable and spot on.  He is driven, positive in attitude, meticulous with detail, and readily available for communication. He is also simply pleasant to talk to. When he had my place on the market this past summer during the pandemic, he was impeccable about Covid protocols. I was moving out of town, and he not only referred me to a realtor in my new town, but he also stayed in touch to provide support.  One day, when the deal on place I had put an offer on looked like it was going to collapse over an inspection issue, out of the blue he called me and said, “I thought you could use some support about now.”  Thanks for that, Dimitri!  He’s a keeper.",

Most recently, he helped us to buy a detached home and sell our townhouse in the crazy Vancouver housing market - all within a span of 5 days. All 4 transactions went super smoothly, prices exceeding expectations, and I think it's largely due to his willingness to do his 'homework' upfront and being prepared. He knows his stuff (and luckily, we listened to him) and he always has our best interest in mind. He's always been very proactive - in fact, that is how he became our realtor, when we showed up at his open house and he reached out afterwards. We cannot recommend Dimitri enough to help with any personal real estate needs.",

And I thought of it as my sanctuary.\nHe also knew I wanted to get a fair market price - even during a pandemic.\nIn other words, Dimitri ‘got’ me.\n\nHe did everything in his power to make this transaction as simple and as stress free as possible.\nI am just so grateful that I found him and that he has handled all aspects of this journey electronically, with as little contact as possible. Through it all he has never failed to show kindness and understanding.\n\nHe has offered his help through every possible stage of the sale and I know I could call on him anytime with questions or concerns.\nHe’s not only thoroughly professional but his kindness and willingness to help has been wonderful.\nI can recommend Dimitri with no reservation.

And even when he was on holidays outside the country, it wasn’t more than an hour at most!\n2) knows the industry, knows the area, knows how to market! I can’t recommend anyone more highly motivated !\n3) answered ALL my questions, went over all the options, explained strategies, but most importantly got results!!!\nI’d give him six stars if I could!!\nI will definitely return to him for my next purchase!",

Once we found our new home, he was also great with the negotiations and closing process and made the entire experience seamless.\nDimitri worked hard to make himself available when we needed him, and would definitely recommend him to anyone in the Vancouver area, and will be using him again in the future.",

Dimitri helped us move from a small condo to a town home to now a beautiful house in the last 5 years. He's also helped my mother-in-law found a great investment property in Olympic Village yielding really great rental income. You can ask him tonnes of questions everyday (some silly and some meaningful), he's always answering each and every one patiently. The process of completing a deal in the recent market can be VERY stressful (and that's an understatement), so it's really important to find someone you can trust who's always on your side and has your best interest in mind. From start to finish, Dimitri was on top of every small detail from photos, listing to completion. He would even stop you from making rash mistake of offering 'too much', or accepting an offer that's 'too low'. He will try his best to negotiate for the best price possible!\n\nThe most important thing is, he's transparent, knowledgeable and offers honest advise in terms of managing any situation, hiccups that can go wrong with completing a deal. We could not have asked for a better realtor to work with. At the end of the day, our family finally, after many moves found our perfect home, and was able to make some money along the way : )",

It turns out he was also living in the neighborhood and had also purchased a unit at Block 100.  After a nice chat, he requested my personal info and offered to keep me informed on market developments, which I obliged despite not having a need for his services and already knowing dozens of realtors.\n\nFollowing our meeting, Dimitri immediately followed up and proceeded to do exactly as he said and keep me informed on market trends and developments.  I was impressed with his professionalism and deep understanding of the market.\n\nWhen the time came for me to sell my 1-bedroom condo in the Olympic Village, I decided to take a flyer on him despite knowing other great realtors.  In this market, you need to partner with someone knowledgeable, professional, honest and accountable, and I could sense he was all those things.  It amazes me how many people settle with such mediocrity and then get taken advantage of by harder working realtors with a deeper understanding of valuations, superior negotiating skills, etc.  You can either pay a fee and get nothing in return (worse yet, cost you money), or you can partner with someone like Dimitri and have them make you money and close deals.\n\nDimitri ended up successfully selling my 865 square foot 1 bedroom for a new record high in the village at that time.  Following that, we purchased a 1-bedroom rental unit at Meccanica.  Everything played out exactly as he had predicted.  The unit I sold had less appreciable upside and prices plateaued following my sale over the coming year.  The rental unit we purchased had at least a dozen offers, and we only won due to our aggressive bid as was advised by Dimitri at the time.  Finally, he had boldly predicted that the purchased unit would topple $1K a square foot in the near future, and a year later comparable units are selling well over that amount.  All in all, his advice and hard work has put us in an excellent position and I'm grateful for his council and hard work as our agent.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend Dimitri to anyone considering his services and will continue to use him as my realtor go forward.",

She helped me buy a condo in 2016, and did a great job of finding places to view that were in my budget and desired neighborhoods. Halfway through, I realized what I really prioritized in a new place, and Leilani adjusted the viewing schedule to match my new priorities well.\nLater, when I needed to find a tenant for the condo, she helped with that search as well. It was especially appreciated because I was unable to be in the same city around that time, and couldn't host viewings for the whole time I was looking. The tenant we eventually found and signed with was an amazing tenant, which was no surprise because Leilani did all the background checking and legwork perfectly.\nMore recently, I decided to sell the condo. Leilani walked me through the process, including advising me on the proper steps for dealing with the tenant at the time. We communicated regularly, but she never put undue pressure on me to lower my desired price, or to accept unreasonable offers. She even helped me find a handyman to take care of issues with my unit as part of the sale conditions.\nStart to finish, Leilani has been an excellent realtor who I can truly trust. I would recommend her to any of my friends who are looking, and will ask for her when I'm back in the real estate market. Thank you, Leilani!",

Unfortunately, all the homes we liked all had accepted offers already. Leilani reassured us that she would do everything in her power to find us a place and was confident of that. Because of this we were confident in her.\n\nShe made sure that we saw any new property right away and after a couple of weeks we found a place! After reading through the documents Leilani had some concerns and we decided to not move forward. She was upfront and gave us all the information and let us decide whether to move forward. She never pressured us to buy and always had our best interest at heart.\n\nWe did eventually find a place which we got a great price on! She fought for us till the end. Even when we finally got our keys and were disappointed with the cleanliness of the unit, Leilani took it upon herself to hire her own cleaners to ensure that it was cleaned properly.\n\nLeilani is very knowledgeable about the market. She is also hardworking, caring and always has your back. I would highly suggest her to anyone that wants a realtor that is not just your salesperson but also your friend, advisor and trusted confidant.",

Well, we did it within a month – all thanks to Leilani!\nWe interviewed several realtors before we decided to hire Leilani, and here is why we chose her:\nShe impressed us with her ability to actively listen and respect our priorities, her strong marketing and negotiation skills, and last but not least, her engaging personality and passion for real estate.\nLong story short, she did not disappoint us. She voluntarily organized and staged our cluttered condo, managing to sell our place within a couple of weeks with multiple offers in a buyer’s market. In addition, she helped us pick a great place while pointing out important factors that we hadn’t thought about as parents; she offered to personally go to some open houses and shared her thoughts. She continuously negotiated on our behalf until she got the best offer.\nLeilani is a realtor who personally inspired me. She made me believe that nothing is impossible with her great work ethic and passion. Just give her a call if you are thinking of buying or selling. She won’t disappoint you!",

She provided valuable information on the market and information about the different areas I was considering. After just one set of viewings she was able to find me the home I was looking for!\n\nI would highly recommend her to anyone who is buying or selling a home in the Greater Vancouver area.",

Leilani has a clear and in-depth knowledge about the fast changing property market in Vancouver. This is especially important for us as non-residents because we were no longer in touch with the market. After our initial failed attempt to sell the apartment, Leilani gave us a clear explanation on what the market was doing and how much our apartment was really worth. She gave us actionable strategies that would make a difference to the marketability of our property, and took it on herself to stage the entire apartment over the course of a weekend - an impressive task all on its own! Even with our time zone difference, Leilani kept us up to date with all communications without delay. Within a week, we received 2 offers and the apartment was sold!\n\nOverall, what we most appeciated about Leilani was her clear and objective perspective throughout the property sale process. She was responsive to all our questions, and made our lives easier by handling small tasks that we could not do ourselves because we were not \"on the ground\". I would highly recommend Leilani if you're looking for a realtor as a non-resident, or simply someone who wants to get a second opinion on your current sale strategy.\n\nPeggy and Rick\nNoosa, Australia",

She worked with her network to quickly identify the houses that not only fit my budget but my requests for resale and rental income.  After three short months of house hunting in a HOT market Leilani helped me close on my first detached home.

Thanks Kory!",

However, it only took 2 viewings, 2 homes, 2 weeks and Kory Prince to land us our dream home. Kory's hard work and dedication saved us $200,000 on the purchase Price, enabling us to obtain a home for our family that otherwise we would have only dreamed of. We wouldn't hesitate to work with Kory again or recommend him to family and friends.",

He was able to devise a strategy for a fast sale, well above list of our home and get us a condo in the same area within our budget with our tight deadline.  We had worked with other agents in the past for our first purchase and to get ideas on the sale, but kory was very keen to listen and advise on what we told him we wanted and needed.\n\nHe was not just \"all bussiness\" which for us was very refreshing from the normal schtick that agents put up, and provided a very comfortable and open atmosphere for our relationship throughout the process.  It was very easy to relate with him and feel comfortable knowing he had our best interests in mind and never forced a decision on anything that we were not comfortable with.\n\nI reccomend him to anyone I know that is looking to buy or sell.  Great experience. 10 out of 10!",

It took us some time to find the perfect home for our family, but Denise was very patient throughout the whole process.\n\nShe also connected us with other service providers we needed like our home inspector. It was a huge blessing because we got to work with people she personally trusted and dealt with. It definitely saved us the time of vetting suppliers.\n\nThe best thing about working with Denise is that she will always look out for your best interests. She helped us negotiate the best price for our home, which was beyond our expectations.\n\nIf you're looking for a home, I would definitely recommend Denise Mai and her team as your realtor.",

We tried to sell our condo once with a different Realtor and the Realtor said that our condo would be very hard to sell as there were too many things inside it. The Realtor said she would only attempt to sell our condo once we rent a storage locker and put our things there. So we didn't even attempt to sell and gave up. Later on Denise gave us a call and asked if we would be interested to sell, we gave her a heads up in our situation and Denise said it wouldn't be a problem. Denise gave us tips on how to present our house without renting a storage locker. THREE DAYS!!! after our condo was on the market it sold for the price we wanted, all of us were so shocked and happy. After we sold our condo Denise promised us that she would help find us our dream home for a price we were comfortable with. Even though our budget was lower for a house that suited our needs, Denise never lost hope and encouraged us that we would find our dream home. She knew current market values and many things about Vancouver Reality. She didn't just tell us the information but took the time to teach us. I now know what a Vancouver special house is. Once we found our dream home Denise worked tirelessly to get it down to a price we wanted. We got the house at a price we were comfortable with and I know it was because of the effort and hard work of Denise, I am confident in saying that no other Realtor would've worked this hard for us. Denise was kind, caring, and, patient towards us. She was never pushy and always listened to our requests. I know that I found a life long Realtor in Denise Mai and would recommend her to anybody, confidently. Thank you so much Denise for everything you have done for us!",

I had my home off and on the market for about 1.5 years before I got fed up and decided to search for a different realtor who could get the job done. That's when I found Denise Mai. She was so easy to talk to and understood my frustrations. I felt like Denise was really there to help me and not just there to make money. By this point I was very skeptical that my house could be sold for the price I wanted. But Denise took her time in explaining to me about the market fluctuations and all of the necessities to help me to feel confident again. Low and behold, 3 weeks after listing with her, my home was sold! I can't thank her enough. She made this, normally stressful process, into an exciting experience for me. She also helped me find my current dream home! Thank you Denise!",

She has an innate sense of what is needed in each moment and goes out of her way to make things happen.

Denise is a super friendly and patient agent who helped me go through all of the transaction procedures. My first visit to a new home was March 14th, 2015, and my final possession date was April 17th, 2015. Within one month, I made my biggest purchase decision, completed all of the legal transactions with bank, lawyer as well as the seller and finally moved into my dreamed home. Initially, my friend recommended Denise to me, when we first time contacted each other through an email, I was still living in Saskatoon. I didn't even know that I could make such a big decision that fast. Denise helped me analyze all of my requirements, we determined the location, price, transportation, community and etc. She sent me emails frequently to give me fresh ideas about new homes and market changes. Later, we met each other in Vancouver, she took me to view various places and introduced the city to me. I can always see sweet smile on her face. Without her assistance, I won't make my decision this fast and probably will miss my current home. I would say I made a correct decision and I love my new home so so so much. Going forward, I will definetly recommend Denise to each of my friend who is looking for a new home.",

He made sure that we understood and were comfortable with all aspects of the conditions. Whenever we had questions, Andrew was consistently quick to reply with very helpful answers and advice that was grounded in experience. Thanks to his excellent attention to detail, the purchase was completed smoothly. He also had excellent recommendations for services like lawyers, cleaners and painters who were all excellent and available at short notice. Both Andrew and Jill clearly cared that we found the right home for our young family. They went above and beyond to ensure that we were happy with the whole buying process from first look through to moving and settling in. We would definitely recommend Andrew and Jill for your real estate transactions!",

They listened carefully to want we needed and did their best to match properties to our particular specifications and budget. They knew the area extremely well and were aware of what to look for, and what to look out for. They pointed out any potential problems during viewings, and also commented on the advantages of certain properties.\nMy husband and I live in a different province (Alberta) and were purchasing a property with our young adult daughter - a home for her in Vancouver. The Hasmans arranged countless viewings with our daughter, and always followed up with us afterwards. We felt they were looking out for all of us, which we were especially appreciative of since my husband and I could not view the properties ourselves. They were bth proactive and fully involved in every step of the process.\nWhen it came to making an offer, Andrew carefully walked us through the process and outlined what would happen afterwards.\nOnce our offer had been accepted, they put us in touch with a great lawyer, and checked in continually until closure. During this time they also checked in with our daughter to make sure she had insurance, internet, utilities etc sorted out. They also were able to recommend tradespeople, should we wish to make any later alterations to the property.\nI cannot recommend the Hasmans highly enough. It was a pleasure and gift to work with them.",

Andrew is the one stop shop agent a first home owner could dream of encountering for their first experience in the market. The daunting process was made considerably easy from initial communications to signing the dotted line. Andrew acted with immense professionalism and went beyond his scope to make sure the purchase was secured with diligence. I learned few years later that Andrew is top listing agent. Andrew and his wife and business partner Gill were outstanding in all facts of the job, old fashioned reliability coupled with a genuine caring attitude and solid advice. Andrew and Gill are those people. They are kind, courteous, and willing to help in any way they can to make your sale smooth and trouble free. I would highly recommend Andrew to all my family and friends and look forward to using his services again in the near future.is nice to come across someone you feel you can trust 100%.",

From the first time we met, when our home was nowhere near ready to be put on the market, Jill and Andrew walked us through a preparation process in a positive, professional and realistic manner.  They gave us encouragement about making our home ‘sale ready’.  We really appreciated a comprehensive list they have of skilled trades people available on short notice to help with a variety of tasks including a gardener, a handyman, a painter, a junk removal person, someone to provide second hand storage boxes and a stager.  Jill and Andrew were available on short notice for questions (and support).  We appreciated their honesty about the market, their intuition about pricing and the timing of our home showing. When it came to look at offers on our home, their wisdom, expertise and professionalism were golden.  When it came time to look for a downsized home, they were very helpful keeping us informed of available homes.  Andrew and Jill made themselves available to accompany us looking at homes we were most interested in.  They walked us through the rather intimidating purchase process and made it manageable. And overall, the paperwork and legal work was all very straightforward, thanks to Andrew’s guidance.\nI would highly recommend Andrew and Jill to anyone including my closest of friends and family to help buy and/or sell any home.  Their honesty, professionalism, wisdom, availability and experience will impress you as they did us.",

Very professional, yet warm, very experienced, yet patient, Andrew and Jill gave us their attention and time, and adjusted to  our circumstances and wishes. We weren’t their easiest clients — we had our own ideas about when to list and how much to ask — and yet they supported and accommodated us in our choices and offered sound advice and guiding information in the process. From the outset, even before listing, Andrew and Jill offered us valuable tips on how to prepare our place for sale and what to focus on. Personally, I feel the most gratitude to both of them for what they did not do — pressure. We never felt pressured to list sooner, ask less, settle. We always felt that the decisions we took were our own. We have sold our property now and look forward to working with Team Hasman to buy our next home. Big thank you to both Andrew and Jill! I definitely highly recommend them for your next real estate sale or purchase in Vancouver.",

I tell you that I am impressed how quickly the offers come in and that is saying something.  They do great work if the client takes their advice, but one should ask him to shop around for more staging quotes before agreeing to stage the property.

Andrew is a veteran Vancouver realtor and it shows - he knows the westside and eastside like the back of his hand. He's ethical, works really hard for his clients, and is highly savvy in all areas of real estate. I trust him implicitly and this from someone who worked with 5 different realtors in Vancouver, as well as realtors in other Canadian cities, before I found Andrew, who came highly recommended by 3 individual friends who were thrilled with their outcomes. To say that Andrew goes above and beyond is a total understatement. He's not only taught me a lot about real estate, but has provided helpful counsel when I've been undertaking property deals in other cities (where he couldn't represent me). My favourite thing about Andrew is how evident it is that he loves his work - he lives and breathes real estate. Passion, experience, generosity, conscientious, well connected, calm under pressure, teamwork w/wife Jill, excellent communication (he listens!)...all hallmarks of a quality professional realtor. I'm so glad I found Andrew and Jill!",

I had talked with Andrew in the past a couple of times about selling and always felt he gave me accurate advice. I never felt pressured. His words were, \"You'll know when you're ready.\" So, when I was ready, even though I interviewed other realtors who also had a lot of experience or who were younger, flashier, and had a better online \"image\" I decided to go with the very experienced and personable (easy to talk with) Andrew and Jill team. I am so glad I did as there were setbacks such as the change in the market, an offer that fell through, and an unexpected,  extensive and expensive removal of an oil tank which no other realtor could have guided me through as well as Andrew did. He kept me calm, focused, and motivated throughout the whole process. I ended up with multiple offers to choose from. I highly recommend Andrew and Jill as they are friendly and energetic, listen to the needs of their clients, are always available to answer your questions, give great recommendations, and get you to a place where you feel comfortable with the decisions you make.",

It had already been on the market with a different realtor for almost a year, with no luck.  When they took over, they made the appropriate suggestions and it worked! Within a short few months (maybe about 4 months max.) they had sold the house and everyone was happy.\n\nFast forward about 5 years, due to unforeseen health circumstances, it became time for our family to downsize.  It all happened so fast and Andrew and Jill were kind, compassionate, intuitive, professional, and oh so helpful with the sale of my mum's house.  They dedicated themselves 100% to making sure the house was sold.  They were not only focused on the sale of the house but also mindful of the circumstances we were selling them under.  After the sale of the house, they helped us in finding our perfect little family home now.\n\nThey took us to many different open houses, back to back to back, until we had no more places to see and had found the place for us! My mum wasn't certain about the place at first.  But with Jill's keen eye for home interiors and reconstruction and Andrew's sharp senses and suggestions, we've now lived comfortably in our home for over five years and couldn't be happier.  They referred contractors and more to help us with renovations and the place really feels like home now.\n\nBoth Andrew & Jill are reliable, relatable, and incredibly knowledgeable individuals with whom I would trust entirely to have help sell or buy a home.",

This made it smoother to purchase the new home and transition in. They were professional where they came up with plans to help us sell our home within the price range and within the time frame we need. They did follow up after we have moved in which we really like and I believe they are not obligated to help us chase back a hold from the buyers but they did it for me so I dont need to do much work.

Jeff our Realtor had taken such good care of everything and it was a seamless process as we weren't very knowledgeable in regards to selling a home. The John Tsai group handled all documentations promptly and there was even a congratulations group chat when the home was sold. Jeff took his time to review and go over every bit of detail and was always available to answer questions (and we had soo many questions). Jeff and the team are super humble, not pushy and very comfortable to speak to. My husband and I were very nervous when we were selling our home since it all happened when the pandemic started. But we were fortunate enough to have gotten a quick offer and the home was sold in a couple of weeks. During this unprecedented time, Jeff was always making sure at viewings everything was done right as we have a little on at home and making sure the viewers were complying with covid protocols. We felt safe to go back in the home and that's so important when viewing your home. If we ever to sell or purchase another property, we will definitely stick with the john tsai group! Thank you team, John and Jeff for such a great home sale experience and especially during a Pandemic!",

Because of his repeated visits to the seller's broker, we have the beautiful home that we like and are satisfied with today. You know, my loan brokers praised him for his professionalism and seriousness. After moving the house, I got his many return visits and preparations 🎁 My heart also sees that he treats customers with heart. After that, the broker who bought and sold the house recognized him and wished him quickly become a famous real estate broker. 💪 💪 💪\n\n(Original)\nMICHAEL CHOU是一个非常专业切认真负责的房屋经纪。从一年前电话认识他直到近半年前准备买房期间，他都会有问必答。特别是这近半年买房期间，他的认真和责任心让我感动。多次看房准备资料充分。因为有了他的多次回访卖方经纪才有了我们今天喜欢又满意的美家。要知道，我的贷款经纪都表扬他的专业和认真。搬屋后得到他的多次回访和准备🎁 心意也看出他是用心对待客户。之后买卖房子的经纪就认定他了，祝愿他快速成为著名房屋经纪人。💪 💪 💪",

I can say that faith is richly deserved and has worked out a 2nd time, resulting in a sale price $300k over the assessed value in a very short time-frame.\n\nHe has the contacts in the industry, a broad reach of prospective buyers, and a thorough and methodological approach to selling properties.  All this combined will ensure Lorne will get you the highest price possible for your property.\n\nHis team (Lyn, Nicki, and his support staff) are also excellent professionals.  They assisted me with all the small details and kept the process moving along smoothly making sure all the documents and procedures were completed - in spite of my hectic schedule.\n\nI have no reservations recommending Lorne and his team and will definitely be using him in the future, and already engaging Lyn to look for our next house.",

Lorne provided a designer who came to my home and gave me great advice about how to best stage it and a photographer who captured it's charms on film.  I had one, highly attended open-house showing and sold the home less than two weeks later for slightly over the asking-price.  Lorne's vast knowledge and experience and his uncanny ability to determine the precise selling price made it happen.  I appreciated that Claire Godfrey, his buyer specialist, showed me a very carefully curated selection of apartments so I didn't waste time looking at dozens of properties.  She found the perfect place and I love my new home.  I very highly recommend Lorne and his team to anyone buying or selling a home; they're the best!",

In addition, Lorne arranged a very affordable 2-year vendor rental agreement which will allow us to live in our house after its sale.\n\nWe decided to switch to Lorne after an unsuccessful 12-months with a national real estate firm. The other realtor had only one open house for realtors and no private showings in 12-months. Whereas Lorne had 19 private showings and 2 open houses in the period time it took him to sell my house.\n\nHis professionalism is outstanding. We were not rushed and Lorne insisted that I have my lawyer check all of the sales agreements that he brought to me. In conclusion, I can strongly recommend Lorne Goldman as a realtor. In my assessment, Lorne deserves a 6-star rating.",

After the purchase, she stayed in contact with us throughout our preparation to move in, and helped us through additional hurdles like rent back periods.

Matt was patient and committed to the project, hosting several open houses and strategizing with us along the way.  Matt listened to our feedback and was proactive with his marketing approach. His marketing materials, including brochure and custom video, were very well done. Matt was consistently available, on time and dedicated to the process, ultimately selling our place to the right buyer.\n\nOn the buy side, we had a specific list of requirements for Matt, and he helped us secure the right place that fit our needs. We toured several properties with Matt and he helped guide us through the process. We had purchased three other properties before and we work in the business, so we were familiar with the process, but Matt definitely added significantly value along the way. We love our new home!\n\nWe would recommend Matt to buyers and sellers who are looking for a committed partner who acts in their best interest and knows how to get a deal done.",

He was very helpful in making suggestions to help make for a quick and easy sale and was always available for any questions I had concerning the process. Right before the open house (and we only needed the one!) he made a couple of little updates and tweaks himself so the place would really shine. He had a great marketing plan which included extensive use of social media and the use of professional photography and videography. All this translated to the place selling within days of being listed, at a very favourable price. Matthew Dolan offers a professional service that I would recommend 100% to anyone.",

His little tips to help us increase the value of or house helped us get an offer for over $50,000 over asking price in just over a week of being on the market! Not only that, when we purchased a house, his superb negotiation skills were put to use when he was able to get us our new house over $40,000 UNDER asking, which is practically unheard of in this hot market. He and Rod Bahari at six zero four real estate have an excellent marketing campaign to help sell houses and I would not hesitate in recommending either of them if you are in the market to buy or sell. Thanks again Matt for finding us our new home!",

Daylan was always punctual, replied quickly to our questions and provided us with the information we needed to make us feel informed and comfortable throughout the process. His carpentry background was also very helpful, particularly when it came to older Vancouver buildings (and the issues with rain screening and the potential need for renovations and the associated costs etc.). After only a few weeks and and a number of tours, we managed to find a lovely town-home and Daylan helped us negotiate a fantastic price, and we couldn't be happier. Thank you for making our first purchase such a great one, Daylan!",

      "text": "The first time I used Daylan’s services, he helped me purchase an investment property in Yaletown. I was impressed by his knowledge of Vancouver’s downtown condo market. He helped me narrow down my search and to decide on which building would yield me the best return on investment as well as providing much-needed strata information. It was so helpful.\n\nBut that’s not the thing that impressed me the most, it was the way he helped me when I faced a family emergency just days before the deal closed. The deal was at the tedious stage, where all of the details about lawyers and paperwork are at their thickest. And thankfully, Daylan was there to guide me through the process. He showed empathy and compassion and went out of his way to help with all aspects.Those are skills you can’t learn in a real-estate course, but are rooted in his personality.\n\nSo fast forward to February 2020 and it was no-brainer that I’d use Daylan again to sell my condo. He was prepared, and knew the market, I trusted his opinions, and felt comfortable with his selling strategy. And  just like how he predicted, I had two offers on the first open house. We had a conditional offer, everything in place, potential buyers were pre-approved, the deal looked like an easy one. However, no one saw the shakeup that was about to happen thanks to Covid-19. Once the world shut down, things in the deal became complicated as the banks were in an upheaval. It quickly turned from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market within days, even hours. Things were unpredictable and what complicated the matter is I was living in London, England at the time, in the midst of one of the world’s biggest coronavirus epicentres. But with Daylan, nothing phased this guy. He continued providing his professional support, including getting up at all hours of the night to communicate with me in the UK timezone. He told me to stay safe and not to worry as it was his job to take care of the deal. I can’t tell you what this support felt like, in the midst of one of the most harrowing things I’ve encountered. The deal was a difficult one, to say the least.Because the banks and the world were shutting down. The economy, the world, was a mess. But Daylan kept his cool. All things eventually finalized and I was really happy with the results. And he offered to help during my quarantine, when I moved back to Vancvouer in April. Those nice things like that, the way people in Vancouver go above and beyond, that’s why we have the best country in the world.\n\nDaylan is an effective real estate agent but also, he’s a really emotionally solid person. This is a combination that makes him successful. I’d recommend Daylan in a heart beat.",

As a result the home received a significant amount of attention on the market.

Ultimately, comparing similar properties on the market, I believe that Pete helped to attain the maximum value possible for our home.

His negotiation skills made us feel comfortable to the price we were willing to pay.  He actually advised us to hold off for a few months while the owner came down to a reasonable price which we were able to secure.

Pete in person was every bit as knowledgeable and helpful as the reviewers all said. He had a well-tested marketing plan and gave us expert advice on how to prepare the condo for sale. His team prepared wonderful marketing material and helped us in all aspects of the sale, from arranging cleaning to the final removal of furniture. He and his team managed to smooth out the negotiation process across two continents and three time zones. Everything, from the initial listing to the final closing of the sale was done in less than one month. The professionalism and efficiency of his team earned my highest respect. If you want to sell your property and minimize stress,  I would strongly recommend Pete's team.",

He's not just another realtor who throws around a title of being \"one of the top realtors in Vancouver\", you can tell he earned that title.  He's extremely knowledgeable about the market and educated me at every step of the way on what to look out for that could cost me money down the road.  A few times he even encouraged me not to throw down an offer because he didn't feel like it was a good investment for me.  He's not out to just sell any home, he's out to build a trusted relationship and knows that will earn my business time and time again.\n\nThanks Pete!",

Like many of you reading this review, I first came across Elliot's name through browsing online reviews and conducting researches on real estate agents in the frantic Vancouver market.\n\nTo be honest, I was a little skeptical of the positive reviews I read about Elliot at first, as the real estate agency relationship is a little more complicated than say Yelp reviews on restaurants, and there is yet a comprehensive platform with peer/customer review of real estate services. However, Elliot's professional manner, attention to details, and personable demeanor quickly made my skepticism mute. Even after a deal has been reached, Elliot has consistently demonstrated attention and care, and offered to assist with the various little yet time-consuming items involved in a sale, such as tending to additional conditions demanded by the buyer, lining up lawyers/realtors, assisting with property search etc.\n\nI have had positive experience working with Elliot and would recommend him without a doubt. In fact, I have already referred his services to a family member.",

Since I was a first time buyer, I didn't know what to expect and was quite intimidated by the process of buying a home. He was very quick in responding to my first message and scheduled an appointment to meet with me to give me information on the current market, the process of buying, and how we were going to get what I was looking for. He took his time to teach me everything and I left the meeting excited about buying my first place! He even looked up listings with me during our meeting and scheduled a showing for the next day!\n\nHe set me up to receive listings once they came onto the market and what I was really impressed with was how proactive and communicative he is! Whenever he saw a listing that he thought I would like he would send me an email with some pointers of the particular listing and whenever I liked a listing, I would email him and he would respond with answers in a heartbeat! He always made me feel comfortable in contacting him with any and every question I had and he always had a super fast response time, doesn't matter what time of day it was!\n\nAll of the above is really great, but what I really appreciated was when it came time to move on a place that I really liked. The Vancouver real estate market is really crazy and because he prepare me for it, I was actually able to get the place I wanted, stress free! The minute I told him I liked this place, he started to work on putting a deal together for me. And because he moved really quick and prepared an offer for me, I managed to actually negotiate on the price (which never happens anymore) and get an accepted offer. He even told me that the condo received TWO other offers after they already accepted ours but because they were too slow, I got it! I even had subjects in there to do an inspection - which he also provided for me for free since I found him on Yelp!\n\nThe whole process was super smooth, start to finish and it was all because I had Elliot on my side! He even put me in touch with a great mortgage broker, inspector, insurance agent, and notary - and they were all great!\n\nI'm super happy with my place and I would definitely recommend Elliot to anyone looking to buy!\n\nBONUS: Elliot informed me that a similar unit to mine sold 2 weeks after I bought for $14,000 more than what I paid!!",

He even took time out of his busy schedule to meet me at a nearby coffee shop on-time and was ready to patiently discuss the entire process when purchasing a home and answered any questions thrown at him.\n\nDaylan has a solid work ethic and works well with other people.

Daylan was my main contact and realtor throughout this process and let me tell you, when you think of the ideal realtor, Daylan should come to mind. He goes over and beyond expectations. A realtor should work for the client and Daylan does just that. He answers every phone call you make to him, regardless of the time of day and answers all of your texts in a matter of seconds. For example, every time I had questions about the unit’s bylaws, he would quickly go and research the information and not only answer them for me, but send me a screenshot of the main source. Daylan strive’s to make the client's life easier. He listened to my needs and requirements and he delivered every time. He is a very punctual individual and I mean down to the minute. He was never late and had the facts on every unit we viewed. Most times he knew more about a building than the actual seller’s realtor. Daylan made my family and I’s experience of purchasing an amazing one and there is no one else that I would ever recommend other than Lee and Pete Vancouver Real Estate Group.",

I sat down with Pete with a list of questions that he was able to answer without hesitation, he then placed me on a search and started a WhatsApp chat between him, Daylan & myself where I was able to ask as many questions as I pleased that was always promptly answered by either Pete or Daylan. Daylan was the primary agent I worked with while we were out viewing homes, and I was delighted by his professionalism and charismatic attitude. He would make a list of what he liked about the unit, what he disliked, and would explain why after each showing. He was always concerned about whether It would be easy for me to re-sell in future while receiving a good return on my investment. Once we had found a unit I liked, Pete negotiated the purchase price down, made sure that all the documents had no surprises and kept me involved every step of the way, as well as recommended a mortgage broker that secured me a good rate and a home inspector that was also a pleasure to work with. I wouldn't recommend any other Realtors other than the Pete and Daylan. They made my first experience purchasing a home memorable for me and my family.\nThank you guys!!!",

We were taking the wrong approach to buying a home; looking at 100 year old houses in a location close to school rather than looking at newly built houses just a little farther away. John is smart and attentive to our needs. I’m so glad we went with his thoughtful direction because now, we live in a gorgeous brand new house with mortgage helper units which will make us money in the long run. Second part to this is of course we asked John to help sell our old home. Again, he was tactful and knowledgeable in helping us decide on an accurate price point and the best staging team to achieve the maximum price for the sale. We sold our house in less than two weeks of it being on the market. That has got to be record speed in today’s market. If you need to buy or sell, John is your guy!!",

When viewing the photos and video, my place looked so great that I almost didn't want to sell anymore.  An accepted offer was received within the first week it was listed, for a price I was very happy with.\n\nI will definitely be going with Leo again for my next buy or sell.",

Very happy to have made this connection, as Leo made our first-time condo buy as smooth and streamlined as possible. We didn't have any preconceived notions about what to expect from a Realtor, but whatever expectations we did have, Leo exceeded them. We'll certainly reach out to him for help in the future, and will recommend him to anyone looking for help with their Real Estate needs. Thanks Leo!",

I learned so much along the way too, which made the experience invaluable. My condo sold within two weeks at a price/square foot above what other condos in the area were selling at.

Leo suggested that this home coule work well because it had been on the market for over 30 days and the sellers may be flexible on price due to the recent price drop. After much back and forth we purchased the home at almost $200,000 under the original asking price.  Leo's market awareness and negotiating skills certainly helped us with this home.  He was very patient over the past 12 months so I am sure he was almost as happy as we were to finally find the right house!  We would recommend Leo to anyone looking for their next home or condo!",

After our first meeting he sent us home with a great first time buyers guide that he and Niki Cuthbert, a Mortgage Broker (who is also fantastic and they just make the best team!) put together, which was so incredibly helpful when everything just seemed like gibberish.\nWe really felt taken care of. Leo was always available, in fact, I remember talking to him a few times on Thanksgiving. He encouraged us to not be impulsive with our decision (I definitely needed that), which was very admirable since I've had a few people tell me they felt rushed by their Realtor.\nI really can't say enough good things, anyone who needs a Realtor will just have to meet him and find out for themselves!",

Throughout the process he was extremely responsive and accessible. After viewing numerous properties together, I knew when I had found \"the one,\" but was apprehensive to move forward when it had all happened in just over a week. Leo put absolutely zero pressure on me, providing balanced views and great insight into the nuances of the offering process - ultimately, the decision was all mine, but I felt totally confident moving forward armed with the market knowledge and expertise he had shared with me. Leo also referred me to an excellent mortgage broker, Niki Cuthbert, who made the process as smooth and painless as possible, while helping me secure an excellent rate. I would highly recommend Leo to any of my family and friends and he will be my first call for any future real estate transactions.",

He truly cares for his clients and has their best interest in mind. He is not like many realtors who are eager to sell, take their commission, and move on to the next client. During our first meeting he gave me his 'Home Buyers 101' where he explained to me in detail how the process works, what to expect, and what 'red flags' to look out for. Leo helped me read through many different strata documents and advised me not to buy twice during the process where he felt it was a risky investment. He's honest and kind, and fun to shop for condos with! Leo will not let you make a mistake and is passionate about placing buyers in homes that will bring them happiness (not stress). From the beginning he was transparent about how he works and what to look out for on the market. He was patient and guided me through the process of finding a place to call home - I shopped for a condo for about 9 months and never felt rushed. Now it seems like a fun part of my week is missing when I don't get to hop into the car with Leo and check out some condos! Leo is a realtor who works with his heart, a rarity in todays marketplace. He also has great resources for home inspectors, mortgage brokers, and lawyers - all three of which I used his recommendations. Niki Cuthbert (askniki.ca) is a fabulous Mortgage Broker who is as up-front and honest as Leo. They are both good people who made me feel safe and confident enough to take such huge step in my life. I couldn't have done it without them and cannot say enough about how great they both are.",

Jess is diligent, responsive, and a clear communicator. What I appreciate most about Jess is how relational and personal she is; genuinely caring for her clients. We are feeling very blessed with Jess, through Prompton. Definitely 5 stars.",

She was very professional and informative from day one. She explained everything required to close the deal. And she was available to answer any questions and provided all supports required for easy and smooth transition from the previous tenant.\nI’m extremely pleased with the apartment and none of this would happen without the great help of Jenna and her exceptional efforts and professionalism.

As a prospective tenant searching for a rental, I came across a unit on Craigslist that I was very interested in. Within the first 24 hrs of the posting, I emailed both the Craigslist email address, as well as the Property Manager who was named on the posting, Corry Buchanan.  The following day, I received an email back from Corry. We went back and forth a couple times trying to arrange a time that worked for both of us. Once she proposed a time that worked for both of us, I agreed and confirmed with her. I took time off work and arrived on the day of the viewing. She was nowhere to be found. 3 phone calls, 1 voicemail, and 1 email later, she was completely unreachable. I waited an hour for her with no response, so I left without seeing the unit. Hours later that same evening, she emailed me back and apologized for not having confirmed the time with the current tenant, and forgetting to tell me that. In her attempt to appease, she tried to arrange a 2:00 viewing on a Tuesday after a long weekend, which negated the entire issue we had discussed in scheduling the initial viewing. Very frustrated, I emailed back asking for a later time. She never responded. And regardless, the posting got removed very shortly after.\nI am so disappointed with, not only the original miscommunication, but the lack of response and carelessness that was exhibited afterwards. It was an incredible display of unprofessionalism and I hope that other Property Managers are held accountable to a much higher level than this one.",

She thinks She is the owner of the hole word and always wants to give orders. Because of that, I was afraid that when She was going to review the apartment on the delivery day, She was going to look for any pretext in order to get money from my rent deposit. And I was right, She did not find anything wrong on the apartment because it was perfect. But now She got a new pretext because the smell. Because of that, I do not recommend Prompton specially with Sharmini. And finally I am still waiting for my deposit! Sharmini told me that She hasn't give it because we are still on \"holidays\" and today is January 8th.\nFinally I rented the studio in $2,000.00cad and in order not to go away, they told me that the new price was going to be $1,600.00cad. You can imagine I feel assaulted. For 2 years they could give me the monthly rent on $1,600.00 instead $2,000.00cad. They are only looking only for Clients that they can charge them more money.",

She and Jess have treated me like family and I do recommend their services.\n\nI had used Prompton in 2019 when I secured my rental in Surrey. And used them again for my new suite in 2020. This year I needed a place with short notice and Megan found a place for me in less than two weeks and helped me in planning my move during the pandemic lock-down.\n\nAs I've mentioned above, I've nothing but good things to say about Megan, Jess, and Prompton.",

I supplied my references, a published business interview and 12 months of bank statements. I was told to have my. Tenancy insurance and proof that this was current and paid for before they would do my initial walk through.\nOn that same day the building manager at the address I would be moving into was pointed out to me and I was told by to be sure to get on the right side of him.\nI had been looking for some time and with this decision made I turned down the other potential homes.\nPacked and ready the movers spent the previous day packing the moving truck.\n9 a.m. we arrive at the new place I am greeted with a gruff \" you better get a move on! \"\nI was then told I only had the elevator for two hours until 11. ( An impossible task to unload a 2 bedroom home off the truck in the elevator and unloaded into a suite on the 8th floor )\nSo I asked when was the next time I could block some time?\nTwo weeks from that day and it would still be for only two hours.\nSo I asked if I could then unload into the lobby and we would then have to good it up the stairs.\nNo, the stairwell use was prohibited !\nSo I told the movers to put back in the truck what they had started to move.\nThis man was not helpful in any way. His manner was confrontation and uncompromsing. I clearly had no choice but to walk away.\nPrompton was aware of these conditions and chose not to advise me accordingly. I was told by the Prompton real estate representative that the move in was my problem to deal with not theirs.\nThis has cost me overtime with the movers and truck, costs associated with now moving to a storage facility and causing me to be now in a homeless situation. I had planned a short move in town and not a move where access and organisation for stored clothes medications etc were needed.\nMoving is stressful anyway. This made it all the more it upsetting. I received no apology, I did however receive a veiled threat to take me to the rental board for breaking the lease. No offer to compensate my losses and continued expenses.\nPrompton Property Management has only one interest and that is to get your money, at whatever cost. Zero compassion to a situation which could have potentially been avoided had they been honest and forthcoming with the demands of a very unusual moving ii n policy.\nOh, and I had to e-transfer $100 to the building manager to have him be at the front door to let me in.\nI would warn against using this property management company. Their dismissive and uncaring attitude has caused me great upset and loss of.money and home.",

Last week, they contacted me saying my insurance policy have changed suddenly and is effective immediately. First of all, Prompton should have inform us right away since Prompton got the notification from the insurance days earlier. Suddenly, Im scrambling to find new insurance and I asked them to verify some information for my new insurance and they never even answered back even though they know this is an urgent matter. I sent emails multiple times but they never answered me back.\n\nAlso, I am trying to cancel their service but they made it really hard to cancel it. If you don't cancel it by 30 days of your renewal date, they will charge 3 MONTHES of management fee. They don't notify you when you are due for renewal so I have to ask them and hopefully, they will email me back this time.",

I then came across a building online and completely fell in love with it. I contacted Megan at the Prompton office immediately as I was very excited to have found my new potential home. Megan took the time to listen to my current situation, wants, and needs. We made an appointment to look at the property of my choice along with some other openings she had available. In the end, the building I desired most had no available units for rent, Megan could see the sadness this brought. I was about to settle on one of the other buildings that I was keeping on the back burner, but to my surprise Megan called me the next day with great excitement that there was a unit available in the building I really wanted to live in! My interactions with Megan were very professional, follow up was immediate, she shared her passion, picked up on my thoughts and delivered 110% I have to give this company a 5 star rating! Anyone moving into any area where Prompton services they come highly recommended from me!",

We requested that it be repaired and it took over two months for it to be completely repaired. The repair man showed up unannounced, he did a poor job and left a mess in our apartment.\n\nWe sent a letter to Prompton suggesting that due to the inconvenience and not being able to use our deck during the summer our rent should be reduced. We also included pictures of the mess left by the repairman and the poor job he did repairing the deck. We provided a them with a suggestion of what we thought was a fair reduction of our rent for the two months (based on the square footage of the deck in regards to the rest of the apartment and our rent). The response we received from Prompton said exactly this,\n\n\"Just so you know that in measuring space, you never include the balcony size so your suite is the size stated and the balcony is extra.  Typically if the balcony is unusable it is about $50 a month taken off. Thank you\"\n\nThere was no apology for the inconvenience or the poor service. The response was not addressed to us specifically or signed off on.  It was simply rude.\n\nThere have been numerous people in our building that have received similar service. I would not recommend renting from a building managed by Prompton.",

From day 1, it has been an incredibly positive experience. Professionalism from the showing through to the application process and any home repair deficiencies that have come up along the way since moving in. In addition to always being professional, Jennene stands above the rest because she genuinely cares. If you are at all familiar with the Vancouver rental market, landlords have their pick of the litter which leads to some very stressful waiting periods as you await the outcome of their tenant selection. During this time, Jennene kept us apprised of our application status, what stage it was in and when we could look forward to a decision. After securing the home, she was accommodating with key hand over and home inspection and very responsive to any maintenance requests we’ve had. Communication appears nearly instant at times and it is obvious there is a high level of client care from her and her colleagues. The reality is a single landlord doesn’t have the strength of a full property management firm such as Prompton. I need my door fixed, they have a door specialist. I need my caulking fixed, they have a caulking specialist. It truly services us the way we should be through the residential tenancy act, which greatly protects the tenant. As much as we are held accountable for being good tenants, having a team like Prompton keeps the landlord accountable too. Rents are high in this city, no denying it. Get what you deserve as a tenant and work with Prompton!",

The Prompton agent would not show me a suite in anything by work hours. To accommodate, I left work early, and due to unforeseen delays was 15 mins late and she did not want to wait. She said it was Prompton's policy to only work till 4:45 and 5:00 was too late. While I understand everyone has a schedule, when your job is to show places to rent to people who can actually afford it, that means you need to be flexible and offer evenings and weekends. 9-4:45 means the only clients you are attracting are those who are rich or not working at all.  Bravo Prompton for clearly showing your stripes.  I suggest those who are considering renting with them proceed with caution.\n\nDecember 2013 Review: My wife and I moved from Calgary to Vancouver on January 1st, and of all the rental places and property managers that we dealt with, Prompton was BY FAR the most professional and organized.  Our agent was Megan Neumann and she was fantastic.  Punctual, transparent, warm energy, offered alternatives and then after move in, was there to address any issues...even 4 weeks later.  It looks like others have had a bad experience here which was surprising.  Maybe it is Megan that delivered such a great experience.    We love our new home and are totally enjoying this awesome city that feels like home more than Calgary ever did.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you would like to discuss.",

The manager of this building is also good. Often what is missing is needed and everything is quickly resolved throughout the apartment. The management is very good and the furniture is complete. Living here is really convenient and comfortable, safe and secure. I highly recommend that you come here for long or short stays.\n\nI am very satisfied with the manager Lynee and Ahmed.
