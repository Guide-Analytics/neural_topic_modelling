Second, I'd prefer less spam from Timothy Murray, Deliverr Account Executive. I understand that you spent good money buying my name off of some list. That's not a good reason to send me an email and especially not a good reason to send me one every other day.

27,602fe6a0f85d750b989a9039,Can't Ship on Time,HK,"Avoid using Deliverr, they were about 84% on-time ship rate for us before we had to ship from our 3PL for the delayed orders to meet platform KPI. Not only is this added manual work for us, but sometimes the Deliverr platform doesn't let you cancel orders that are ""packed and ready to ship"" even though they are 3 business days delayed already. Now we're forced to decide whether to risk double shipping an order or get dinged for a late ship. This means those customers will get two shipments and have the option to return one of the shipments for a refund.

Unfortunately, there is a high cost of removal from Deliverr, so we're held as a hostage until we sell out what we have of our inventory there. I (my pocketbook too!) regret trying Deliverr. We're switching back fulfillment to our third-party warehouse instead. Link it with EDI SaaS like shipstation, find an account with discounted ship rates, and you'll end up having more reliability and about the same cost even without the economy of scale.

Integration with any new service or partner usually has its own set of unique obstacles, but Deliverr's support has been there for us and helps us work through the issues. Support has always been available, transparent, and quick to resolve issues.

Not only are they proving to be a stable fulfillment partner which allows us to support higher sales volume, but the many integration features are helping us on the marketing side as well.

Their service is a great concept and prices are great, and it started out OK, but they are growing way too fast or something. The service has seriously gone downhill in the last few months. For example:
- Orders over Cyber Monday took 2 weeks to ship out and almost got canceled by Walmart. Despite what Deliverr claims, this still hurts your Walmart delivery metrics.
- They are CONSTANTLY losing inventory now - both inbound and inventory in their warehouse. They sit on orders for a few days and then email you saying you should manually fulfill it, because they lost the inventory, leaving you to scramble to ship it out yourself. This is happening for 30-50% of orders lately.
- Their support is helpful but EXTREMELY slow. It takes WEEKS and multiple messages to hear back from them. Several times, I had to email their executive team directly to get any kind of response.
- They don't add any bubble wrap or protective packing to boxes. They literally stick your product inside a big cardboard box and seal it up. Absolutely indefensible for a reputable fulfillment company like them. I emailed about this multiple times, but they didn't seem at all concerned about it and didn't promise they would change anything.
I do not recommend them anymore!",2021-01-08T19:24:04.000Z,1,0,Keith,1.0,2021-05-28 13:31:19.457894,2021-05-28 13:31:20.646021,Deliverr,Trustpilot

42,5fdf9c0f755dc107e0c998bc,A joke of a company.,US,"Site looks easy to use, but that's where the positives end. Outbound SLAs are frequently missed with no penalty. New warehouses are frequently onboarded and offboarded, causing inventory to be unavailable for weeks while moved from warehouse to warehouse. Inbounds take almost a month to check in. Shipments are frequently lost or tracking information is simply incorrect and the claims policy is inconsistent. I do not trust inventory levels, and canceled orders for stockouts frequently occur without fast alert (email takes 2+ days to let me know an order has been canceled) or visibility into why an order was canceled. These issues are frequently blamed on listing tools, while I experience the same issues creating orders manually. I have had customers contact me to let me know they have received 10s of extra units they did not order (and I can only imaging how many hundreds of units are out in the world that customers have not let me know they have). Support team is not well trained and obviously understaffed as tickets take days and sometimes weeks to receive a response. Measuring process is inconsistent and warehouses frequently make mistakes; I have had to manually audit all my dimensions and request reimbursement for overcharged fees. Tickets frequently need to be escalated as support staff cannot keep up with frequently changing policies. I can't wait until I sell through my inventory with this terrible company and can sever my relationship; I do not trust they can accurately remove my inventory.",2020-12-20T18:46:39.000Z,1,0,Melissa Nesbitt Romano,1.0,2021-05-28 13:31:30.353897,2021-05-28 13:31:32.597774,Deliverr,Trustpilot

Pretty common for orders to remain hanging after they have been marked as fulfilled. I'd only realise after some chargebacks hit me or refund request emails from customers.

Their 2-day and next day badges helped our website grow from $10,000 a month last year to $150,000 a month this year.

The only cons are that some of the carriers partnered with Deliverr have a tendency to lose shipments. But this could also be attributed to the increase shipment numbers of 2020 across the board. The other problem is that having a third party fulfill our orders increases a harder to resolve customer service questions as most customer service questions revolve around fulfillment.

Everything from their transparency and easy to understand pricing model, easy setup process and incredible on-boarding support. I worked with Fulfillment specialist Shawn S. and was extremely impressed. This is not a back office call center team. We had 2 calls and walked me through setup and even recommended that I get setup on Walmart and told me how to get fast tags on Google and Facebook. The support doesn't stop there either, I'm going to be working with an engagement manager to help me optimize my e-commerce sites.

In under 2 weeks, I setup my Deliverr account, sent shipments to Deliverr, signed up and went live on Walmart, Etsy, Facebook Shop and Shopify. Prior to using Deliverr, I only sold on Amazon.

As a small business owner, I'm excited to take my business to the next level and Deliverr has made it incredibly easy. I only wish I knew about them sooner. Thank you all!",2020-09-03T21:21:50.000Z,1,0,Linda Bogdanova,5.0,2021-05-28 13:32:32.905133,2021-05-28 13:32:36.125181,Deliverr,Trustpilot

Tyler,

Our account has been inaccesible for 3 days now without resolution--the system stopped recognizing it. We will be moving both of our accounts to another service as soon as possible:
• Tech support is incompetent, often referring problems to “other team members” who then fail to respond in a timely manner, if at all.
• Tech support response time is never prompt, sometimes taking 48 hours+ to respond that a response is coming.
• Deliverr has no method for personal contact, email only. This isn’t enough in case of an emergency, and there does not appear to be any prioritization of support requests.
• Apparently customer support closes on the weekends.
• All businesses must deal with the problems of the Corona Virus, but Deliverr has demonstrated no ability to adapt or improve its support.

We request you forward this information as far up the company ladder as possible. Deliverr is a company that is “in over its head.”

We sell supplements and were looking for a new pick, pack, ship partner around 2 months ago. We chose Deliverr over ShipBob and so far are very happy with our choice.

- To date we have sent in 2 inbound shipments, each to 4 different fulfillment centers. The receiving has been relatively slow (1 to 2 weeks) but all items have been eventually received with no errors or missing inventory.
- Deliverr has shipped out to numerous customers using ground, expedited and Walmart 2-day delivery. These shipments have all gone out either same day or next business day. We also sent some test shipments and the packages all arrived in good condition. A small issue is that the packaging used varies from warehouse to warehouse and there is no packing slip or invoice included.
- Our account executive, Shawn Sprauer, did a great job both during the sales process and while we were onboarding with Deliverr. He also helped us get approved to sell on Walmart and really made a difference during the Walmart onboarding process. We are now selling on Walmart with free 2-day delivery.

Overall, it has been a very positive experience with Deliverr and specifically with Shawn Sprauer and I can fully recommend them to other companies looking for a new fulfillment partner.",2020-07-24T14:59:27.000Z,1,0,John Barrow,5.0,2021-05-28 13:32:40.647417,2021-05-28 13:32:43.841611,Deliverr,Trustpilot

MAIN ISSUES

1. Deliverr is a B2B software + service. But they do not allow user permissions. Organizations cannot create sub-accounts for employees to use. Everyone is forced to use the main master account which include sensitive billing info and other user functions that the shipping manager does not need access too.

2. Initial registered email on Deliverr account cannot be changed. The first and only email you can ever sign up with Deliverr is set in stone and unable to be changed at all in the future. YESSS, its 2020 and this is still happening!!

3. Deliverr's software does not allow you to untie a sales channel integration. So if you integrated a sales channel with a Deliverr account. Be prepared for that sales channel to lock into your Deliverr account FOREVER.

This was my experience. I signed up with Deliverr and with my google account, thinking I can just create a sub-account for my staff...

WRONG - no user permission function available. Our whole organization need to use the registered email to log in. and I had already integrated my sales channel to the account.

NO PROBLEM? We signed up using a new email, Fresh start. Ready to start sending in goods and becoming a paying customer.

BUT NOOOO. new email would not allow us to integrate our sales channel. Stating it is still tied to the old account.

Reached out to customer service, it took them 8 days to come to the conclusion that they are unable to untie it, and said they can change over the registered google account to another email.

I gave them the email, and they have completely ghosted and never heard about. The standard protocol for Deliverr's customer service is if they do not have an answer for the customer, they will just ignore them.",2020-05-18T09:05:00.000Z,3,1,Victor Lam,1.0,2021-05-28 13:32:43.841611,2021-05-28 13:32:45.067721,Deliverr,Trustpilot

79,5e9a1722086b6409bc8724c2,Deliverr not honoring onboarding promotions,US,"Deliverr did indeed call us the same day I posted this review below. They were very supportive and granted us the advertised promotion.

Our company rarely writes reviews, but are having such a difficult time with Deliverr onboarding promotions, this warranted a quick 5 minutes. We are (were) a $2 million company, trying our best to manage and weather the COVID storm. With supply chain and fulfillment understandably locking up at Amazon, we were turning to new vendors to assist us for our B2C deliveries from various channels. Deliverr came highly recommended by a few business colleagues! We were told about a $500 promotion - both for the onboarding company (us) as well as the firm who referred Deliverr.

But once we signed up, our IT team spent a half business day integrating with our Walmart account, eBay account, Ecommerce site, and Amazon Prime ... that sales rep simply ""ghosted"" and refused to approve the promotion.

Really bad business and pretty harsh customer service - especially given the hurdles we small companies are all facing during the economy changes. What a lost opportunity, as we would have turned around and referred then to all of our network of company owners?

I attempted to send in a critical mass of my items to get the ball rolling, but had to send in more than I wanted -- with Amazon FBA I would typically send in 2-3 units of a new item, whereas here it was a minimum of 10 per SKU (now down to 5), and then as soon as a couple of the units sell, you lose your Fast Tag shipping tag, thus defeating the purpose (the only way Deliverr can meet the 2-day shipping requirement is by having units near the customer, so if you have units in stock at Deliverr but not at enough fulfillment centers, you lose the tag).

Then I start getting invoices every two weeks for $80 here, $200 there – wild amounts of storage charges for my tiny products. I have products where I can fit 100+ in a single cubic foot. I thought my storage fees would be nominal. Little did I know!

Now I have to pay again to get all my items shipped back to me. Oh, and I also had to pay for an integration partner (Sellbrite, SellerActive, Geekseller, etc.) to integrate in the first place.
