On another trip they wanted $21 plus some change to USPS a package. I took it two doors down to the USPS and the cost was $9.95. So UPS charged more than double.

78,ReviewRow-735,Deceitful,"UPS is supposed to make two attempts at parcel delivery in case no one is around. In my case, that never happened. On their first try, UPS left the package on the front of my door, three feet from the sidewalk. The package was stolen. I tried to contact UPS but their customer service department does not seem to exist. If I could give you zero stars, this is what I would do. As far as I am concerned, UPS is deliberately deceitful.

I called UPS Customer Disservice many many times over 2 months (only 1 willing to give name). Like robots, they all read the file explanation that ""receipts/invoices were not included""! This is a falsehood, as they returned these to me! To date, they refuse to reimburse me for my undelivered parcel, and claim they do not have a return policy (3 agents have stated this in my recorded phone calls).

Furthermore, UPS doesn't even supply notification that items are being delivered.

This is unacceptable and in many cases, as with Amazon and Best Buy, UPS is a de facto monopoly as they are the only carrier used.

When the box reached its destination it was delivered as shown in the enclosed photo. When I politely contacted the ups store I told him I was not looking for compensation. I only wanted to make them aware of the horrible condition in which the package was delivered. They refused to take the complaint or even look at the photo. They simply said ""damaged packages happen."" Apparently that is not true with FedEx. I have received monthly shipments of wine. Each professionally handled and all without a bit of damage to the box when they arrive. Thank you FedEx!

Overall, I like UPS and have had for the most part good experiences with them. But, recently we purchased an item from Amazon which was shipped via UPS. We received notification from UPS that the package was successfully delivered to some place about 30 miles from us. Ok - mistakes happen, so we figured we'd call UPS to get it straightened. Um, no,... not that simple.

We tried multiple times to get through to a person, and each attempt they kept pushing us towards their website and to file a claim. So, after going round and round, I finally gave up and filed a claim.

I was able to up-load pictures of the order, along with the confirmation. About 10 days later we receive a notice from UPS that they had confirmed there was no package delivered to our address during the time the package was confirmed as delivered. And...? Nope, that's it!

Ah geez, no I have to call in again... After about 40 minutes and going round and round I finally got through to a live person. I gave her the pertinent information and she put me on hold while she took a look. She confirmed that an investigation had been instigated - was that you? Yes! ""We can not initiate an investigation with packages sent from Amazon - they must request an investigation.""

First, I packed 15 boxes of my stuff for the move, 2 being large boxes, and the rest being small. I made sure to ship those 15 in advance so when I showed up to my home in Texas it would be there. My mom convinced me to not ship my belongings with Fedex or USPS because she believed it wouldn't be there on time. Well I ended using UPS, and while I was there I made it clear I didn't want any of the boxes being separated. About 4-5 days later my brother(who I was moving with) told me my packages came. I told him to count them and he only counted 12. Naturally I freak out and call UPS. They told me to make a claim. As I was about do so, my brother told me more packages came. Only two had shown up, and not to mention, they showed up on a different truck. It's been two weeks and I filed a claim and have talked to customer service almost every day and I have yet to receive an update. But that's not it. On my day of departure to Texas I shipped TV out. I stupidly chose UPS to do it because I thought it'd be there quick, and plus it was cheaper. I thought that since it was one package that it wouldn't get lost. Well I was right about that, it didn't get lost, and it came on time. Instead of that, it was broken. Mind you, I used an entire thing of bubble wrap, and also used an entire roll of foam, plus had the original styrofoam holder for the tv, and paper on the bottom and top of the tv to give it extra hold. The package is was taped so securely it couldn't have fallen out. I just cannot understand how they could've even broken it unless they actually tried. I'm am so infuriated with this company it's unbelievable. They don't care about your stuff, they only care about the money, and I advise to never use them for anything.

My second package was handed to me by a total stranger who said he saw it and tried to ""pick it up and knock on my door"" but he ""accidentally dropped it"".

For my current package, I tried to log onto UPS.com but our info didn't match so I clicked ""I lost my password"" and I was asked the same security question they said I answered wrong, over and over until UPS fraud froze my account and locked me out.

My package was supposed to be delivered on Friday, 3/12 but it was late (of course) and the driver didn't bother to update the website. I couldn't do anything because I was locked out of ""MY ACCOUNT"". UPS FRAUD dept locked out the only person that could tell them if it was FRAUD and went home for the weekend.

352,ReviewRow-511,Worst delivery company in the history of the world,"Every time I order anything online and see that is being sent by ups I cringe. I have lost count of the number of times I have complained about the way they throw things over my unlocked front gate onto my cement driveway with no regard for their fragility and lie about delivering them to my front door. This has been an ongoing problem for years. I only ever have damaged items when they come by ups. One item arrived recently with dirty shoe prints all over it, and another one and its contents was badly bent, and that packaging, a white extra rigid mailer, is something that you'd have to really work at to damage it the way this one was damaged. The last 2 deliveries were delayed for bogus (delayed due to natural disaster or severe weather conditions, neither of which was true where I am, and it said out for delivery that day, so it was already in the area) or no reasons, and I am still waiting for that second delivery to arrive. Two of the items were surepost, which would have arrived the next day by usps if ups hadn't said they would be in the area and deliver them a day early and then didn't deliver them at all. The service gets worse and worse. A few months ago they started throwing things over my driveway gate again. More often it has been the unlocked gate. I put a sign up on that gate directing the UPS driver to my smaller unlocked gate, and that worked for a little while, but then it was back to the usual again. Except on rare occasions they don't deliver anything here until at least the evening, it has always been that way for years, and as it gets later and later they don't deliver anything at all. The drivers are so stupid and lacking in initiative that they see my driveway gate has a lock on it, and in spite of the number of times I have told them that my other gate is unlocked and have always had it on record to deliver items to my front door, they continue to assume, without even checking, that my unlocked gate is locked. Sometimes my complaints have been completely ignored, sometimes I have had a phone message saying they would talk to the relevant depot or driver, and occasionally things temporarily improve, but they always go back to such terrible service in no time. Their quoted delivery times are pure fiction and are never adhered to. I don't know why they continuously quote delivery times when they have no intention of delivering anything then. When they have a follow my delivery map, they are often close to my house early in the day but then drive farther away and around in circles all day. I don't know why anybody even uses this awful company.

When it has come to picking items up, it's the same story. They have not come through my unlocked gate but have stuck 'sorry we missed you' stickers to my gate, my mailbox, or put them inside my mailbox, having made absolutely no attempt to come to my door. This has happened many, many times. I once had a faulty computer to return and waited in all day every day for 2 weeks for them to come and pick it up, with complaints in between and assurances the computer would be collected. In the end I had to drive way out of my way to a ups store, otherwise I think it would still be sitting here now.","June 23rd, 2020",3,86,Cynthia K.,1.0,2021-05-30 12:13:48.446393,2021-05-30 12:13:50.663667,UPS,Sitejabber

I ask the person behind the counter if it was ok if I just leave it to be scanned later. She attacked me verbally and ask if I thought I was better than everyone else. When I replied no, it did not need her attention at all, just thrown in a bin.
She was mad because everybody had packages that need to be boxed and taped. She told me to go somewhere else with my Amazon return crap. They did not want it. I left the box and walked out. She followed me and grabbed the little package and threw it at me as I was leaving the store. Then her manager came out and told me to never come back with Amazon crap.

Due to recent events, that I'll keep private out of respect for her, my wife had ordered some sentimental items weeks in advance in order to have them by a specific date. UPS has failed to deliver these packages in a timely manner; usually this could be excused for the potential lack of drivers due to Covid possibly, however there have been numerous occasions where we'll be waiting on our porch for the package to arrive only for it never to show and the driver confirm that the package has been dropped off. UPS has changed from a delivery system to a waste of space that another more competent company could make better use of. When contacting customer care we were greeted to the generic ""there's nothing we can do"" punchline. There's something we can do though and that's take our business elsewhere. In conclusion, if you need a package delivered to you, whether it be important or not, use a different shipping company don't use UPS because it clearly isn't a shipping company since your items arent delivered to you. So please heed my warning and save your money and more importantly your time and use an actual shipping service.

2) If UPS knows that they've lost it, and tell the customer so, why must the sender start an action case? Surely it can all be handled in house?

A: What's in the BOX?,"I've had issues with UPS previously, such as delayed items, etc., but nothing too egregious for me to consider them worse than FedEx (who I consider to be bottom-of-the-barrel-bad). Then again, not many of the shippers who I received deliveries from in the past, had ever used UPS enough for me to have developed a concrete opinion about them. Until now.

Anyway, against my better judgement, I had purchased through eBay again, and waited excitedly for my package to arrive. Unfortunately, when the box did show up, it was split open on two sides, torn, three of the corners were damaged/sunken in, and most telling and laughable (if it had not been so sad), was that it had been left in front of my door, actually balancing on one of the sunken-in corners of the box. Almost like a joke.

The worst part, I thought, upon seeing the box in that state at my door (although I do admit that UPS may not have known this during shipment), was that it contained electronic equipment of a fragile nature. Upon thinking about it further, however, I realized: WHO CARES whether UPS specifically KNEW it contained electronic and/or fragile equipment? Shouldn't they transport each and every package with the care necessary to ensure NO damage to ANY package? You know - almost as if EVERY package contained electronic and/or fragile equipment? Nope. No care whatsoever, and as I later discovered upon opening the box, the remote control was missing, a leg and foot was missing, two sets of cords were missing, and the main unit was broken (missing a chunk of its corner and side).

Upon seeing this, I contacted the seller who assured me that they had ""packed the shipment well"" and that ""apparently the shipping company was loading crates on it"". Now, I did not really believe the seller, because:
1). I realized upon opening said package, that this nincompoop had basically just
Thrown everything in a box with NO padding, foam, crumpled-up-newspaper
- nothing for protection;
And
2). How would/could he know that the 'shipping company was loading crates on it'?

I THEN contacted UPS and asked if they had a ""Lost & Found"" of sorts, where missing items from a package might be held at. They said that they did not. I then asked if there was a way for me to possibly contact the actual warehouses where it showed that the box had physically been at. I told them that I was simply interested in seeing if I could track down the MISSING parts and pieces, the remote control, especially. I was told there was no way for me to do so. I then asked if there was possibly somebody, ANYBODY, who might want to go beyond what was generally expected of them, and perhaps reach out to a couple of the locations to see if maybe they found a remote control of some kind. They said 'no'. I was, however, told that I needed to file a claim and that as part of said claim, they would investigate what may have happened to the missing items.

Seeing as the shipper was sticking to his guns that the sale had been a ""no refund"" sale, and that he had ""packed the shipment well"", I filed a claim. I mean, IF the shipper had packaged it less-than well, shouldn't UPS have refused to ship... or after acceptance, again, shouldn't they just have handled it with care?

A couple of days later, I received a call from UPS telling me that they were closing the claim and that I should advise the seller to file a claim since HE was their customer.

I told them to F-off.

Personally, I will never give this place a dime and will (try) to avoid sellers who state they ship through them.","July 14th, 2020",3,251,Jaqi M.,1.0,2021-05-30 12:18:56.266093,2021-05-30 12:18:58.499647,UPS,Sitejabber

Amazon says, that at the UPS access point they have to scan the code, pack the package and send it back to Amazon.
The problem was, that the guy at UPS access point did not even had a scanner to scan the barcode for the return. He send me back with the package and said, I have to print the code and stick it on the package.
So I went back with the package and the code on it. But even this was again not ok for the UPS guy!
I think, this guy does not know what he needs to know to send a package back to Amazon?

Amazingly it was still delivered on time, so did it take them a whole 5 minutes to figure the suite #. At $18, the person working must get paid over $200 an hour for the price to be justifiable.

They lost my package but that's not the problem, the problem is the awful inexistent customer service.

They delivery person never called my phone or my buzz code, I checked the door as soon as I got the ""delivered"" email, nothing there, nothing in the mail room, no notice card, I checked twice with different concierges at different times and they had nothing for me.

I called UPS to report this, all the operator was able to do was to send me an email with a link to make a claim, and guess what... the link didn't work! I had to look the claim form up, so that phone call was only a waste of my time.

I filed the claim, they had it on ""reviewing"" for like a week, then they closed it saying the package was found/proof of delivery was given - yes, like that one or the other who knows which one applies to my case. Of course, I read that accessing my account on their website, they never bothered in actually getting back to me.

I knew they offered terrible services, so I never use them by choice but this was for an order made at Walmart - i. E. not my choice. I'm now waiting to see if Walmart will refund my money for the order never delivered.

480,ReviewRow-320,UPS IS TERRIBLE AND SO IS THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I ordered a package from Fashion Nova on 03/06/2020. I paid for overnight shipping which was an additional $19.99. They told me as long as I place my order before 1 pm, I will receive my package the next day. I ordered my items (Black Jumpsuit & Gold Studded Earrings) at 10:57:07 am. I got an email Saturday 03/07/2020 at 9:15 am stating that I have a delivery scheduled for that day. The driver of UPS put my order as delivered at 10:28 am, but there was no package delivered around my house at all. They even put that they left it at the front door. I have cameras that are on my porch and it was no signs of UPS on my porch not what so ever. I reported this immediately to UPS but no one has called me back. I've called several times and all they did was file a claim. No one checked with the driver, The store did not call me either. I asked several times for a supervisor, but no one has reached out to me yet. I contacted Fashion nova immediately to let them know whats going on. I am going to send in my Camera recordings to show there is no signs of a UPS driver dropping off a package in between 9:15 am & 10:30 am.

1) Package coming from the EU, on the tracker they said Thursday, so I asked to work from home so I can be present during the delivery. Because apparently they started to leave the package to the doorstep ONLY since Covid... yeah... right... good excuse...
So I was waiting, at 9AM the tracker said, out for delivery... then at 5 pm it changed to the next day... Furious I called, I had a very nice lady (the only time) and I asked her to NOT leave the package on the doorstep, which she replied that the delivery man needs to leave a note to reprogram the delivery and change the address (if necessary). I said ok and thanked her (I also ask to leave an official complaint), the next day I received a message while I was at work, saying that my package was delivered... It was a 3.400$ equipment left on my door step outside where anybody could see it. When I came home, no package... Thank God a nice neighbour took my package to protect it. This is outrageous and using the Covid as an excuse to leave package on the doorstep... this is what this company do for years!

I've had three different conversations with representatives today the first two were very polite but made promises about my package that didn't come true. The first told me someone would contact me within an hour to update me, two hours later, nothing. I went back on with another rep to see if anything was going to happen, she told me that they were sending my package to be delivered tonight, and to watch for the delivery. I waited. For three hours I waited by the window so I'd be sure not to miss them. And no one ever showed up. So I tried talking to another representative, who told me I would have to pick up my package at a facility. That would have been great information FIVE HOURS AGO, at which point I could've driven to get my package before they closed. I don't know why it took five hours and three conversations with service reps to reach an actual conclusion, but it shows how very effete UPS is at accomplishing their one, simple task: deliver item from point A to point B.

517,ReviewRow-876,UPS Canada audits your packages with different measure than other logistic companies by their power,"UPS Canada audits your packages with different measure than other logistic companies by their power laser scan. A few inches difference doubles your shipping expense.

Received a new invoice of extra $157 charge 1 month after my shipping. Because UPS's unique measure methods found 6-inch difference in my shipping package. Then I spent more than half a month to communicate with UPS through Netparcel because I selected UPS from Netparcel.

I used standard U-Haul box with dimensions 24 x 24 x18, the charge was $125. The extra charge invoice shows the dimensions are 28 x 25 x 19 with a charge of $282.44. Dimensions cannot change for standard boxes, I sent UPS a photo of my shipping box dimensions clearly written outside. And, 6-inch difference costs more than double of the shipping fee? Seriously? It's just a double mistake from UPS.

After more than 2 weeks' communication. UPS claimed that 1. They used their laser to scan the dimensions; 2. The dimensions I provided are dimensions inside the box and not outside the box. I feel it's like a robbery theory.

So, if you use UPS you have to measure the inside and outside of the box you use, remember a few inches different will cost you double of the shipping expenses because UPS has their own power laser scanner which measures things differently from other logistic companies.

This is obviously ridiculous and a robbery behaviour. 1. If UPS uses different metrology from other logistic companies, this company has to publicize this to customers. 2. I don't think we are obliged to measure the inside and outside of the box. If customers have to measure the inside of the box and outside of the box, the world does not move anymore. 3. If UPS found 6 inch difference from their metrology, so they can charge more than double of the shipping price, I believe UPS needs the government to regulate this business.

Go rob the bank is easier than fooling people.

Now, we understand that it depends on what the shipper chooses to use to send our packages, however we have had explicit difficulties with UPS and how they deliver our packages. For the past 2 weeks we have not received packages that have been shipped with UPS. Instead they have told us that they were not able to deliver and dropped the packages off at a store that holds packages for UPS. The issue with this is that, my wife works from home and has not heard one knock from the UPS driver. When it all started we were given a note that told us where the FIRST package was dropped off. Since then they have not even attempted to drop anything off at our home. I went to the store where they were holding the packages and not only did the ladies there receive the first package that was supposed to come, but they received 3 others that we had ordered to our home as well. They have not tried to communicate with is at all despite our attempts to let them call us if they think they are in the wrong place. I have put mine and my wife's personal phone numbers on the door for them to use if they had questions or concerns. Not only have they disregarded them but they seem to have deliberately skipped over our address to deliver to the drop off store almost 2 miles from our home. What makes this even more frustrating is that their customer service is non existent and there aren't any people in their customer service line at all, so we can't ask questions or make requests, we are at the mercy of this driver.

I am very upset with UPS. I called them 3-4 days advance to hold a package for me at the drop off station when it arrives. Come to find out that package was delivered to the wrong address. I understand it was my fault to double check. But you would expect them to have your back. Now I lost out on the item due to it being irreplaceable. This was a Valentine's day gift for my wife and I'm unable to find that item due to me ordering the last pair of shoes. They really dropped the ball and I am PISSED. I requested them to be responsible for the cost of the shoes but they are not cooperating. I didn't get the women's name or the manager name due to me being upset. I will never in my life do business with this company. FedEx is way more reliable than UPS because they are very detailedon there delivery process. Below is the address where my package was delivered to. Someone dropped the ball and I demanded an answer on who it was. Was it the rep that took my request or was it the delivery person who didn't check the notes.

530,ReviewRow-307,UPS pickup service & the culture of their customer service are both awful,"I paid to have three small packages (with prepaid labels) picked up today between noon & 4pm. My car is in the shop so I needed UPS to come to me (first time I've tried the service). Two UPS trucks (that came but then immediately drove off) and four difficult phones calls later, more if you include the multiple internal transfers, still no pickup.

I stopped counting the number of contradictions & lies I'd been told when it got to seven or so. I can forgive a bit of incompetence, mistakes happen, but I was shocked by the seeming culture of lying at UPS to deny responsibility or fob off what they had agreed/were paid to do. How hard is it to pick up packages, especially when you're UPS?!

The last time I felt tempted to cry on the phone with a business, from the sheer frustration & insanity of trying this hard to get what I paid for, ad infinitum, was in 2004. It was that... special.

In the end I requested a refund (even in that they tried to lie, saying I hadn't been charged yet when I very clearly had been). I had an Uber take me to my local UPS & back. Even though that cost more than what UPS charged for a (non) pickup, I was appreciative of the quick, hassle-free experience (I had spent an hour or so on the phone with UPS today in addition to physically chasing a leaving UPS truck).

I will never attempt to use UPS Pickup service ever again.

I was surprised by the level of ineptitude & willingness to lie within the company. My local UPS store (where I drop off packages) is reliable & friendly. UPS shipping (after boxes are in their system) has been reliable for me overall -- I can forgive the occasional box being delayed by a day compared to their original estimate.

What I can't forgive is today's comedic tragedy & exposure to the business culture of UPS. If you can't deliver on a service --> don't offer it. If you mess up --> don't lie.

(THIS IS FOR ALL OFW WHO'S PLANNING TO SEND BALIKBAYAN BOX.)

Last NOVEMBER 27,2020 I sent TWO PARCELS from SOUTH KOREA TO CEBU, PHILIPPINES.
Since I can't go home because of the pandemic we're facing right now. I decided to send package to my mother. Before I already sent parcels many times to CEBU CITY.

I have always been using EMS POST OFFICE because of their fast and reliable service. The EMS POST OFFICE told me that ""Only UPS COURIER can go to CEBU CITY, PHILIPPINES."" So, I have no other options but to send my package using UPS COURIER. I paid DOUBLE PRICE FEE than the usual I paid for EMS POST. I was hopeful that my package will be delivered early. And ""YES, IT WAS DELIVERED EARLY and THAT WAS THE SECOND PACKAGE.""

The First parcel has a tracking number 1Z65533F*******217. And the Second parcel has a tracking number 1Z65533F*******407.
The second parcel was delivered on December 1,2020 at 4:19 pm and paid CUSTOMS Tax amount in Philippine Peso 2,516.00 (Two Thousand five hundred sixteen peso).

So, I was hoping that the FIRST parcel will come anytime soon. But days, weeks, and months passing by it hasn't arrive yet. So, I wonder what happened. I sent an email to UPS CUSTOMER AGENT. Fast forward, we exchanged mails with the agent. They asked me documents such as AIRWAY BILL, PROOF OF PURCHASE, AND CREDIT CARD STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT. So, I have given all of the documents they asked.

Then again, they are asking ""FDA PERMIT."" Then I emailed them again. ""Why are you asking me FDA PERMIT? When I am just sending these items as gifts. Is there any other way so that my parcel will be delivered? Or should I pay more tax than the usual?"" and then they calculated that I should pay the amount in Philippine Peso 5,285.00 (Five thousand two hundred eighty-five peso). Then I agreed to the agent that I will be paying that amount just the parcel to be delivered.
The last email that I have received was on January 15,2021. ""This email acknowledges the receipt of your message. We'll proceed with customs clearance tonight."" Then I waited again and hopefully it will be delivered anytime soon.

Last January 26,2021 and February 17,2021 I have sent an email to the agent but the agent didn't reply. So, I sent an email to their new agent last March 2,2021 and give the necessary details of the parcel. The agent replied to me March 3,2021 the again we've exchanged mails until she said ""I regret to advise you that I am still waiting for our counterpart's feedback regarding the retrieval of your abandoned parcel."" So, I replied her back ""The parcel wasn't abandoned. I even agreed to pay more tax so that we can claim it. And your fellow customer service agent told me last January 15,2021. ""This email acknowledges the receipt of your message. We'll proceed with customs clearance tonight.""

So, the agent again replied me on March 10,2021 and said ""I have received a feedback from our Brokerage Group that unfortunately your package cannot be located at the moment.""

And now, I am DISMAYED and FRUSTRATED. I think my gifts inside the parcel was already been used by them. At the end of the day, no matter how many emails and documents we send to them. They are trying to tell ""Just give up! Its already lost or the items have been damaged and used""

SO, I WILL NEVER AGAIN USE UPS COURIER. THIS IS MY FIRST AND LAST TRANSACTION OF THIS COURIER.

Packages arrived late, sometimes damaged, sometimes on time. The past two packages have been utterly ridiculous. We have commercial delivery. Was supposed to receive a package on Friday, but got an email at 2am saying because of situations out of their control a package that 2as sitting in their facility 7 miles away couldn't be delivered until Monday. Ok, situations out of their control. I get it. Then on Monday I get an email saying the tried to deliver on Sunday to a commercial address and of course couldn't deliver, but left a notice on the door. Really? The driver was able to go through a locked chain link 6 foot gate with 2 feet of barbed wire on the top to leave a notice? Wow, he's some kind of liar. No notice was on any door or the gate. They then gave the package to usps with no delivery dates to go with it or any information because that was on the invisible notice left by the driver. Now today, a package was to be delivered, issue today is they have it on a residential delivery schedule till 9 pm tonight. Um the office will be locked up again. No one showed and we can't use my ups because it's a commercial address and won't recognize the address. Tried 6 different ways to contact a human, can't, no one available because of COVID.

550,ReviewRow-380,Terrible service,"UPS Hungary is the most pathetic service one can have on Earth. I shipped a package after paying 150 USD from USA to Hungary. It reached to their Budapest store which they call Vecses in six days and the package is lying there for the last ten days without any headway. They play dirty tricks. First they say the name of the receiver is incorrect, once you update it then they say the address seems to be incorrect, once you update the address then they say that there is no phone number of receiver on the package. I told them that on the airway bill it is mentioned but still they would insist to provide. Once you update the phone number then next day they say the receiver has requested to reschedule the delivery!, they then schedule a delivery but no one comes! They again say on their tracking web that a new reschedule is in progress. I have called their support centres 50 times to check what's going on? The call center from USA respond but say that they have no direct contact with Hungary center? But also make promise to help. The support center of Hungary don't hear a call, they receive the phone and put it on the side without answering anything. I have read in the reviews that these people are thieves and do the same tricks and then steal the package after declaring it that no one received it. You can not find any UPS mail address to report this matter directly instead you get Robot replying you standard answers and they don't even understand what you are trying to convey them. It s my humble request to everyone that please do not send your package to Europe through UPS especially to Hungary. HUNGARY UPS is a monster, it eats whatever it receives.

But then, don't tell me you can... I needed to send a check to our realtor for the house we just made an offer on. It was in a different part of the state, about an hour and 15 minutes drive. Our realtor asked us to overnight it since we were down there the day before. I went into UPS and the gentleman said yes, they could overnight it and charged me $46.98 to do so. I asked if he knew what time of day it would arrive so I could let the recipient know. He said because of the pandemic, he wasn't sure what time it would get there the next day. He never said it may not make it until next week! If he had, they would have lost business, because we would have driven back down and given it to our realtor. Unfortunately, it was a holiday week-end, so our envelope did not get there until Tuesday when we originally sent it on a Friday. After our realtor let us know that she had received it on Tuesday instead of Saturday, I called the store where I initially sent it from. The gentleman said he would put in a ""guarantee service refund"", but that UPS had suspended it's ""guarantee service"" as of 3/24/20 because of the pandemic.

554,ReviewRow-785,"DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS! ""DAMAGED THEN LOST?""","On the 22nd Of January, my package was sent by the seller, shipped by UPS who picked up the item. Within a day they had damaged my item and Halted its shipment in Stanford Le Hope, United Kingdom. After trying to get in touch with them on several occasions they could give me no information as to what happened to my package nor how it was damaged.

After getting in contact with the seller they agreed to send me a replacement item as UPS had damaged the first one. My replacement item was shipped out on the 28th January via UPS again. Within a day on the 29th, it was scanned in Transit to Feltham, United Kingdom and I received an email stating my package would be delivered on the 1st February between 12:45 and 16:45. This time came and passed.

By the 3rd February, the package had still not arrived so I got in touch with UPS via their customer service landline. I was on hold for 40 minutes before speaking to someone, who told me that my item was at the West London Delivery Depot waiting to be shipped, they then arranged a call back from West London who called me within 15 minutes to tell me that they did not have my item and that It was still at the London Hub and was told to call customer services back. I then called Customer services back, again on hold for 40 minutes, where I was then put through to an agent who said she was going to email the London Hub to get an update on my parcel and request expedited shipping considering they had already damaged my first shipment. I was told by the agent I would receive a call by 5 pm that day (3rd February) or by 8 am the following morning (4th February) from the London Hub to update me.

This never happened. I waited the entire day (4th February) and received no follow up. At 5 pm I decided to call Customer Services to ask them what was going on after I was on hold for 20 minutes I was put through to an agent. They told me It was not possible for an agent to have emailed the London Hub and that they neither have the record of that email nor the capacity to email a hub from Customer services and that the agent I spoke to previously LIED to me.

Rightly enraged, the agent suggested I escalate to a supervisor who I was put through to after 1 Hour on hold, relaying that it was not possible for the agent to have contacted the Hub and I was given FALSE INFORMATION. This Supervising agent stated they would get in touch with the hub directly and call me back. Then attempted to call London Hub (4th February) 18:30 and proceeded to try to do so until 19:00, where the line was constantly engaged. I was called back by the agent at 19:07, where I was informed he was unsuccessful in getting in touch with the London Hub and that he would try again tomorrow morning when his shift starts.

5th February morning around 11:37 I was contacted by the supervising agent who informed me that he had been in touch with the London Hub and that they were manually looking for my package and that he would receive and update from them regarding the status later in the day, once done would follow up with a phone call to me. At 14:30 I was called back by the supervising agent to let me know that they could not locate the Package and that it was LOST. Then proceed to tell me that I have to start a claim online to launch a Tracer/Investigation with would take 8 WORKING DAYS and that it was unlikely that they could find my item as the personnel on the ground already could not locate it.

Instead, after investigation of a week or so, it was discovered that the package was delivered to an Amazon lock box. Intended recipient and sender tried to find out why it was sent there.

Instead, they looked in their database, picked up the package 3 weeks later and sent it to the intended recipient's previous address from 10 years ago in a different state! Continued visits to the original UPS store once a week yielded different stories each time with eventually telling sender the shipment was to be investigated-mid July. No call backs to sender until August 13th when UPS in the state where the intended recipient had lived 10 years ago called to say they had just received a request to research the location of the package on August 12 and, that they were sending someone to that residence(5 weeks after it had been delivered there in error.)

Not to mention, some of the pieces(nuts and bolts) were missing but I didn't even report or complain about that because the package wasn't insured. I was told that they would have to do an investigation on the package arriving to it's destination late and it will take about 7-10 days. I went to UPS today December 22,2020 to inquire about the investigation just to be told that I will not receive a refund, credit, or anything because packages are arriving late due to COVID. Sounds like pure BS to me. So I just spent $64.11 for nothing. I might as well shipped ground for $51.11 less than what I paid. I thought the customer is always right or at least UPS should have compensated me in some form of fashion making at least my next two shipments free.

Paid for a 4 day delivery.
90 days later they finally admit to losing the parcel.
But it's not over, because they have found every excuse they can to drag out the refund process, and now I have to take them to court to get my money back.

UPS is the worst company to deal with. They are like children playing a game, making excuses, lying and refusing to do anything they claim to do.

In the conversation so far, they have apologised more than 30 times. They repeatedly ask for my contact details and then offer a new review or investigation, assuring that someone will get in contact. I must have had 5 of these, and at no point has anyone contacted me about anything.

The continually return documents claiming missing information, when the information is in the document they return. Their stupid behaviour is unbelievable.

And then they will suggest you phone their support telephone number, which is only a good idea if you want to be put on hold for over an hour, to finally be told by some manager that they will sort it out, which of course they don't because no-one does anything they say they will do, ever!

Use UPS if you don't want you parcel to arrive.
Use UPS if you want to waste your money.
Use UPS if you want a frustrating period of trying to get a refund, or any answers at all.

If you want your parcel to arrive, use another company.

Two weeks ago, they lost a package and when it finally was found, the UPS store access point employee apologized even though it wasn't his fault. The package was mangled and taped and the metal item inside was all bent up and scraped. Last week, a package scheduled for delivery on Tuesday was finally routed to the customer service center on Sunday, while they were closed. On Monday, after waiting 3 hours in the customer service waiting room, I was told to enter the ""secure area"" and find my own package and bring it out. And then this solid wood speaker cabinet was dented and the box had a huge hole in the side! The customer service employees there had asked their manager multiple times just to come out and see how bad it was, 17 of us were waiting in the lobby, and we heard him tell the employee over the phone that he refused to come out to us. Now, a package that arrived in the area on Sunday, was to deliver yesterday (Tuesday) and postponed to today. Now, AFTER the access point closed, they say they attempted delivery and had to postpone to tomorrow again. I have started looking for ways to cost them as they cost me -- time, money, aggravation...

On June 24, I dropped a package at the UPS store located on 1767 Central Park Ave South, Yonkers, NY 10710 containing a return of an item purchased from Amazon.com. The clerk scanned the QR code sent by Amazon and printed the label. I requested a receipt and I was told that it would be emailed to me. I never received it. A few days later I returned to the store to ask about it. I was told that sometimes this happens. He scanned the QR code and confirmed that it was received by the store and it should be on its way. He suggested me to track on the website using the track number in the QR 1Z53Y*******223. I did it and the information was that the label was only created but the package was not received by UPS. I called the store and was suggested to call UPS customer service. I did and the attendant told me that was sending me an email confirming the filing of my claim. The message only had a link to file the claim. I tried and I could file the claim because UPS does not recognize that it has received the package. I am in a loop. The store does not take responsibility neither UPS does. The time Amazon gave me to return is about to expire and I will loose the product and the reimbursement.

CEO, UPS

Mr. Abney,

My brother and I are extremely upset that this very unique painted family treasure, with a silver plaque to recognize our grandfather, has been ruined and is beyond repair. My brother lives in Hove in the UK and I live in the US. I have used UPS frequently here with no problems, ever!

You will see from my brother's review that we are not claiming monetary recompense because we could not put a value on it, but a better response from Customer Service would have been nice.

The bookcase was always in our parents house and we traveled a lot since our father was an Officer in the RN. He was a decorated war hero who risked his life for years so that our generation and those after us could live in peace. My brother took the bookcase after our mother died in 2006 to be passed along to his daughter. The world is a very different place today, with respect almost non-existent!

As it stands now, we plan to never use UPS again and will urge others not to also. We look forward to hearing from you. We also hope you will forward this to your colleague in the UK to record an abysmal failure by UPS Customer Service.

Sincerely,

Sally Jenks Roth

Subject: A review that I wrote to UPS self explanatory
To: Sally Jenks <*******@gmail.com>

Unbelievable, horrific, saddening experience that has left my family numb!
An ornamental book case presented to my Grandfather, Sir Maurice Jenks, Lord Mayor of London on 4th November 1932.
This remained in the family in very good condition until November 2019. Yes 77 years!
Then UPS got their hands on it for a simple delivery from High Wycombe to Hove.
It was delivered smashed into hundreds of pieces and beyond repair. The cost of this shipment was £105.60
I decided to use UPS as I did not want to transport it by car in case of damage.
I have stressed to UPS, that I am not after money as no market value could be put on this item but the sentimental value is beyond money!
I have asked for an apology but the claims department would not do this. I suppose that apology would be an admission of responsibility.
They say that they will not investigate as we can not show them the bubble wrap and carbon carton that it was shipped in. There was no damage to the outside of the packaging and it was marked FRAGILE. They took so long in contacting me that we re cycled the packaging to tidy up.
I have asked them to at least investigate the chain of delivery to make sure that this can not happen to another person's delivery. I also asked if they could send a recording of my phone call to a senior director of the company but they claimed that they do not record conversations. Strange as when you call them, the recording says that the phone call is monitored and recorded.
In conclusion all I can say to potential customers of UPS is "" USE THEM AT YOUR PERIL ""","November 27th, 2019",1,0,Robert J.,1.0,2021-05-30 12:26:49.038260,2021-05-30 12:26:52.224800,UPS,Sitejabber

584,ReviewRow-864,UPS - IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG YOU ARE UP THE CREEK WITHOUT A PADDLE!,"Yes, we all receive packages shipped UPS. For most of us there are no issues: the package arrives pretty close to the scheduled delivery date. However, when the package does not arrive on time and you contact UPS your nightmare is just beginning...

I had a fragile unframed watercolor shipped UPS from France on March 23rd. As of today, it still has not been delivered. I hope the package is intact. For several weeks the information posted on the UPS website was ""Warehouse Scan"". I contacted UPS by email and telephone. The representatives parrot the tracking information posted on the UPS website: ""Warehouse Scan"". They could not determine why the package was sitting in a warehouse. I escalated the request and spoke to several supervisors - none of whom could provide better status. At one time I spoke with supervisor, Mark and explained that his employee had promised to call me back with an update and hadn't done so. Mark said he would ""investigate"" the status of the package and personally call me with a status update. That did not happen.

The website also indicates that ""Import Fees are Due"". The online payment system didn't work so I called UPS and made payment with credit card a month ago. However the website alert is still there. I was told by UPS that the alert would disappear when the package arrived in the USA. That did not happen either. I called several times, including earlier today, but apparently there is no one at UPS that can remove the alert or direct me to someone who can.

I called again and was advised that the brokerage unit would contact me within an hour to review the issue. That did not happen either. When I called and was connected to the brokerage unit the representative told me that the customer service unit always tells customers that brokerage unit will call them back within the hour, but that, in fact, the brokerage unit does not do this. Huh? (Sounds like an easy fix...)

It is as if UPS has a basic template for package delivery but has no tools in place to handle the exceptions that fall through the cracks. The customer service representatives are courteous enough but there is no value added. If indeed the customer representatives can only repeat what is on the website then perhaps UPS should downsize the customer service staff and focus on reliable data and better website accuracy.

Today I asked the representative how to apply for a refund. The 3 day shipping has taken over a month and the interactions with UPS frustrating and unhelpful. I was told to contact the shipper and ask the shipper for a refund. Apparently UPS believes they have no responsibility for their role as a package delivery service.

UPS does not know the meaning of customer service or process improvement! The representatives and management staff show no interest in either improving the customer service experience or product delivery information. When I asked to speak to a manager to file a complaint the representative said he noted my concern. I queried ""So will a manager be contacting me?"". He said no, he was only noting my concern... (whatever that means...)

It is unfortunate but I cannot say that I have had better service with FedEx or DHL either. However, the UPS experience is definitely the worse case scenario. I wish I could ship USPS from France. Despite the critics, I have always found their services to be more reliable.

I had a package sent on a Thursday to be delivered the next day (Friday). Paid additional fee so it would be delivered in time. Tracked package Friday afternoon and UPS tracker said expected delivery date that following Monday. I immediately called the place I had sent from, (3:30pm) they called and said the package was picked up Friday. She was with UPS driver on Thursday when he picked it up and stated that to Customer Service. I called (4 pm) 5 times to get connected with a Manager finally after talking to 6-7 people Manager got on phone (8 pm) he emailed UPS to immediately change delivery time to Saturday. At 10p tracking showed Saturday delivery. Saturday morning I tracked package Again and delivery was changed back to Monday. (Mind you this had someone's job on the line which created the urgency) I again immediately called to be told they don't know where the package is due to being in transit. I went to UPS pick up location to be on the phone again for 2 hours. I personally looked up UPS locations in area of where package was to be delivered and guided them in time frames of those locations to delivery point. I told the Manger I wanted my refund ASAP since I paid for next day delivery, he said the sender location could call Monday to file for refund. Sender filed and followed up 3x and UPS stated they have no file of claim or phone calls of my issue at hand. Now we are past their ""allotted"" 14 days and are refusing and still claims they have no file of all phone calls. I call BS and they need to do a better job taking care of customers. Honest opinion they need trackers on every truck and the driver should be required to scan into and out of their vans.
I would advise to use FEDEX or DHL. Or you'll get ripped off!

The woman I spoke to, at first, seemed to be helpful until I started asking more questions. She gave me three different answers to the same question, where is my package? First it was it would be 5 business days for it to be delivered to the USPS then it takes them 2-3 days to deliver it and UPS is closed on weekends and holidays, including New Years Eve, then it was we won't have any updates until Monday then if it hasn't updated since yesterday your package may be lost and you have to file a claim. I asked her, ""are you just guessing because you answered the question in three different ways so which one is it""? I also said I am in shock that the USPS is open on more days of the year than UPS. She put me on hold to ask her supervisor, she then came back on the line to give me one of those three. My package will be delivered to the USPS on Monday then they take 2-3 days to deliver it. I asked her how her supervisor knew, did you guys play a game to guess and she said she couldn't speak for them I then asked for her name and her supervisor's name. She gave me hers, which I doubt is real, then I asked again for her supervisor's and she said I can't give you their name. I said then put your supervisor on the phone and let them give me their own name and CLICK disconnected! I am absolutely sure that she took a bathroom break while I was on hold and never asked anyone anything. I am in shock and extremely angry. A birthday gift for one of the most important people to me, my Auntie. I ordered it early so there was no chance of it being late because I couldn't purchase it in a store and she's extremely hard to buy for. If I ordered this and it went out for ground service on 12/27 shouldn't it be here on 1/3/2020? It says on my UPS app estimated delivery time 1/2/2020 End of day. I ordered something the week before Christmas and it was there when it was supposed to be, well a couple hours past end of day, but who cares about a couple hours? I'm trying to find out if I will have my package by 1/10/2020 and they can't tell me?! I am blown away by the reviews I've read online and I am copying this review everywhere I possibly can. I'm sure if someone listens to our conversation I came off like a B, but not until she started giving me different answers with no explanations. It should've been a short call with a quick answer. Oh and by the way, UPS is open on New Year's Eve, she said they were closed and that it wasn't considered a business day. Maybe in the country she was taking this call in but I called from the United States. I hope this review reaches someone who cares enough about their company to look into this and contacts me.

Terrible customer service, they are an administrative mess -- the store allegedly had me all set up but then it was put on hold. I was not notified of the hold and had to call 3x to find out. Then they asked me to fill out the same(ish) form I had already filled out saying they were missing info they already had only to put the package on hold for a second time, and again did not tell me. I called 4x and they AGAIN asked for info they already had, only to say that it had been lost. The claims process is with a mysterious unreachable department, the employees have hardly any info and are not that helpful given that they did not have updated info. Almost no two employees had the same info about my package. The UPS website is awful to navigate and very glitchy. The Claims dashboard does not surface information properly, the tracking itself wasn't smooth either. Over all the user experience of the website makes me feel that they have never hired a user experience or interface designer. Interns not out of uni make better websites than they have. Deplorable. All this and who knows if I will get reimbursed, the documents were uploaded only for the claim to not show up in my account, it has been faxed into the ether (YES, they still suggest FAX! - I dont think they have had a digital transformation in this company. I signed up for all possible alerts with my email and phone number and did not get the important ones. They allegedly said they had sent me a letter for the reimbursement forms which obviously they never did. I have been lied to more times than I can count, or their systems are just so inefficient and broken that there is zero accountability, and no way of telling if any of the info they are seeing is correct. No follow ups, nothing. Seriously awful service have been battling for months on this issue (3 months almost) and it would be a holiday MIRACLE if this doesn't drag into next year. Wouldn't even be surprised if they do not pay me back the 400 dollars worth + 50 shipping +12 price of fax (lol) because I didn't have additional insurance... which by the way it doesn't say anywhere that they wouldn't but a kind man at the fax place said that they may not. I would leave a no stars review. Do yourself a favour and do not use UPS, do not fall for their ""better"" prices... learnt the worst way possible you really do pay for what you get, and in this case you might as well flush your package down the drain along with 600$ and call it a day.

I just watched ups deliver a package nextdoor and i have a package out for delivery on ups ground and he got back in his truck and sat for a bit and drove off. When I tried to call ups to make sure he had ny package i was unable to get a human on the phone to make sure they could verify where my package was. As I have had so many bad experiences with ups drivers no caring about thier jobs amd just not delivering my packages and getting a delivery delayed notice at 9 at night that my package would be delivered the next day. I thought here is another example of the driver just blowing off his job. So call customer care or cutomer we don't care and you arent allowed to talk to us number and maybe get a person that could find the driver with my package and make sure i got it but no endless hell of virtual prompta that end up hanging up on you as you are not allowed to speak with anyone at ups until there is an expetion with your delivery. As I typed this I got the notification that package delivery is now delayed so the driver could have just dropoed it off but instead drove off and now I have to wait another day because UPS is one of the worst companies ever.

A)
I was to receive a package from Costco via UPS on 6/24/20 before 10:30 am, as the notice stated. I was at my business at 8 am and remained in my office which is 5 ft. From the entry door. At 9:15, after preparing my coffee which the coffee maker is less than 2 ft from the entry door, I checked out the entry door window and to my surprise found a, ""Sorry we missed you..."" UPS tag. So, I immediately checked my security system footage, and it showed the driver came to my door, checked to see if it is unlocked and then made out a slip and placed it on the door. No Knock on the door nothing. The door has a sign that states, ""PLEASE KNOCK."" This business is by appointments only under the current covid-19 situation. Find this out and seeing the video footage I was upset. I changed my schedule around just to wait for this package to arrive and your driver didn't even do the basics. Being that I needed this package immediately which is why I paid extra for it to be shipped expressed, I immediately started calling UPS and Costco. I did finally get ahold of someone at UPS after an hour (which is completely unacceptable as well). The lady I spoke with said nothing could be done and the delivery would be tried again tomorrow. I informed her that the driver never even knocked on the door. She basically said too bad.

I contacted Costco and informed them of the situation in which they refunded the delivery amount.

So, I went about my day and was working outside at the same address with my bluetooth headphones on, when at 12:50 pm, I heard a, ""Hey!"" (pretty loud even with my headphones on). I turned toward the sound and saw an UPS delivery person in which I took off my headphones. Before being able to say everything like ""hi"", This delivery person Yelled, ""WHAT THE HELL IS THE PROBLEM?"" I simply requested that he set the package down and go. He again yelled, ""WHAT THE HELL IS THE PROBLEM?"" OK, so I told him. I told him that I was literally standing on the other side of the entry door at the exact time he was there and he did not knock on the door, and that I even have a sign that requests that. His yelled, "" BULL$H[T!"" For the second time, I requested that he leave my property. He refused. Which then I informed him that I do have a security system that clearly shows that he did not knock and that I can show it to him if he would like, and that he is currently being video and audio recorded. He grabbed his ""Sorry we missed you..."" UPS tag and started waving them at me and again yelled, BULL$H[T, YOU GOT ONE OF THESE, DIDN'T YOU?"" and I replied, Yes, however that doesn't mean that you knocked which I do believe that is something that you are to do."" I then requested that he leave my property for the third time, again he refused. I informed his again that he is currently being video and audio recorded that if he does not leave my property I will call the police for a threatening and intimidating person. He yelled at me, ""YOU'RE FU$K[NG BAT$H[T CRAZY!""

By this time my 2 dogs were starting to be worried and my neighbor, who lives behind me came and stood on my property line to get a better view and assist if need be.

I had more than enough of his guys behaviors by this time, and while still keeping my cool, I commanded him to leave my property and I started to go towards him. I was completely prepared to physically remove him from my property if needed as now he is criminally trespassing and has become a threat. As I got right up next to him, he swung out his arms at me then turned around a started walking off my property cussing at me and again yelling that I am fu$k[ng bat$h{t crazy. I did tell him that he is lucky to have left my property because he was about to find out what bat$h{t crazy would have done to you.

I immediately got on my phone and called UPS customer service and filed a complaint with a gentleman that seemed to be concerned about the situation and once he took down the complaint, stated that someone would call that day. On one called then nor has since. I read on UPS that UPS takes complaints very seriously, however I beg to differ.

After this happened and I did not receive a call about the complaint, I decided that I was not going to support a company like this that obviously considers this as acceptable behavior from their drivers. I called Costco and file a complaint and told them that I will never order a delivery from them if they continue to use UPS. I then returned the item and purchased it elsewhere.

I own 4 difference businesses, 2 that do a lot of shipments to clients. I have decided that we will no longer use UPS since I do not want to subject my clients to this way of treatment and do not want my clients to have a bad experience from ordering from one of my companies. I also have contacted all of my suppliers and requested that they do not use UPS for my businesses or I will refuse delivery, every single one agreed to use other carrier services.

638,ReviewRow-123,Worst carrier experience ever,"I'm writing this specifically over experience with UPS Russia, but probably it's transferrable to branches in other countries as well. They've had scheduled and promptly cancelled two consequent deliveries based on a fact that the brokerage fee haven't reached certain department within UPS. A side note - I've paid that fee using wire transfer within the country on morning of a working day, which absolutely means that money will not reach a destination account within same day only if payer's bank held the transaction for some reason. For two days, I've been woken at 6 AM with texts saying 'your box is on the way' and both times drivers was unaware that the payment for their broker services have been reached UPS (opposite to what I'm being told by their support service). Taking extra fee for the brokerage service itself with taxable stuff (approx $50 vs approx $20 for non-taxable contents) is probably ok, but fscking everything up in continuance is something I've not seen in a long time, including carriers famous for for their incompetence.

In short - you should avoid UPS for all non-standard cases and take a very great measure choosing them for unimportant or time-insensitive stuff. I've wasted $150 (broker fee plus non-refundable cost of delivery) for a relatively small package and the mess they could easily avoid if someone could have at least tried to bind processing flows of the accounting and delivery departments together.

644,ReviewRow-823,Worst customer service ever,"I had placed an order through Costco online and, received a delivery date of 9 Mar 21 and so i waited at home all day and then around 5:34pm i looked up the tracking number and it said the package had been delivered. Yet the package had not been delivered as i was at home waiting for the package and i have several Ring cameras watching my door and street. No UPS vehicle pulled up to or passed by my house. So i called Costco because at the time i was unaware of who was delivering as all the emails i received said Costco. While on the phone with a very helpful Costco Rep. He was calling UPS and trying to find my package after his waiting for a long period of time he finally was able to get information, i talked to him from about 5:30pm until about 6:30pm. He told me that UPS reps would call me and discuss why my package had not arrived yet. He also said that UPS said it would be about two hours before they called, and that their drivers could not come back out after 7:00pm. So after the call with Costco was over i waited and it was about two hours until i received a call from UPS. Once I received the call from UPS they explained that their driver ACCIDENTALY delivered my package to 207 Piccadilly Cir. As i didn't know where that address is they took the time to look it up and tell me oh its close to you. They told me I could go pick up the package from the address they made the mistake and delivered it too. I told them I was not going to go to a strangers house at about 7:45 and just walk up to their door. I would not appreciate that happening at my house so I wont do it to some one else, and it can be dangerous to do that if you don't know the person. I live in Texas and people own firearms to protect themselves and loved ones and property. I told the UPS contact that they need to have their driver go back and get the package and they told me the Drivers cannot go back out after 7:00pm. They told me he would pick up the package on 10 Mar 21 and deliver it that day. So on the 10th I waited again and the package still did not arrive, so I called UPS again and gave them my thoughts on their unprofessionalism as I didn't not miss deliver my package they did and all they had to do was send some one to get it the day before. After talking to the UPS rep for a while they Had the same Supervisor call me back and explain that my package was takin to a local UPS store and that they had called them and asked them to get the package ready so a driver could pick it up and deliver it to my location. But this did not happen as the local store told them that it was in the back with 350 other packages and was to be shipped back to McKinney the original spot that it was sent from the first attempt. At that point they told me it would be delivered on the 11th. I said ok, but it needs to be the first delivery and I didn't care about their routes or issues making it happen. So I sit here on the 11th waiting for a package I hope will be delivered and yet once again it says my package may not be delivered until 9:00PM. Why do I have to wait until 9:00pm for UPS mistake and their unwillingness to make this situation right. All they had to do was send a uniformed person to the wrong delivery address and I would have had my package and the poor lady at her address would not had to drive to a UPS store to get it redelivered. I in no way blame the Lady who originally received my package and don't blame her for taking it back to UPS as she probably felt the same as I did going to a strangers house to give the package back. It is the responsibility of a company who is in the business of delivery which means they are supposed to be professionals. One of thier mottos on their web site says our fast just got faster, not true. Incompetence is what it is, the companies Sr. Executives need to take a look at all their operations and fix this system. As i have talked to many of my friends and associates and we all agree that UPS is not a good company and that they go out of there way to ensure they do not use them. If you think about using UPS you might want to think twice before making that decision if you want your package delivered accordingly.

It is very difficult to do business with them and their prices for small business - even with supposed discounts - is MUCH MUCH more then the Post Office.

Let me just give some examples from my most recent attempt to use them. I had an order from France and since we've had several shipments return by the French Post (Colissimo) recently due, I thought we'd try UPS. I had to manually enter the shipping info because we were unable to get our UPS account to work with either STAMPS.com or XPS ship shipping tools. After I entered everything I got an error telling me my account was inactive and to call customer service. I searched on the website and finally found a number to call only to get routed through automation hell and could not get it to transfer me to a real person until I had entered a tracking number, which of course I didn't have. I was never offered an option for what I needed. The standard voice command ""operator"" didn't work. So I hung up and tried again using another number. This time I used another routing path that didn't really apply but this one finally got me a person that then transferred me. The rep that helped me simply had me activate it online. Why then did the error message have me contact customer service when I could do it online? I then had to reenter the info for the shipment only to discover the cheapest price for a 1.9 lb shipment in a small 12 x 12 x 8 box would cost WITH MY SUPPOSED DISCOUNTS $140.56. By comparison the rate with the USPS for Priority Mail was approximately $42. That is highway robbery. The supposed ""small business"" discount I was given after a 25 min+ telephone call (they reached out to me) about a year ago.

UPS did not care to inform me that they forwarded the claim to the original shipper - Keystone Auto. I find this out when I call about two to three weeks later wondering why I haven't heard anything back on what their disposition is.

First of all they told my husband and I it would cost $20.00 for a package that we know would only be half that at the post office. Then they told us it would actually be a dollar more to send through the post office. We finally agreed to this because we were trying to save ourselves some embarrassment because the next package we had they claimed would be $30.00 dollars to send (again from past experience at post offices we knew this was not true. When we asked them the post office price they claimed it would be $38.00! This one we hauled back out of there. One other package (even though larger) was a much better price and they said even though it was 3 times as big as the (so called 30 d0llar package) it was because of shorter distance. Anyway back to the $30 - $38 dollar box it actually was going to be $38.00 at the post office, but they offered a much lesser cost of $16.70 (just longer to get it at it's destination) When I asked UPS about that feature or what the cost at the post office would be at a longer delivery time they mumbled something about mailing it the next day (not what we meant about it taking longer!) Crazy answer. So, we paid for the huge box at a not so bad price mainly because we did not want the recipient to know what we paid for the postage, overpaid on the one box (our stupidity for not wanting to be more embarrassed) and hauled back home to our local post office with the other box and paid the more normal $16.70.

701,ReviewRow-154,Outrageous delivery experience,"I cannot believe the terrible service I've received and the stress I've been through because of UPS. I called them on June 18 to let them know that I needed my shipment to be held and delivered after July 1st as I had not moved in yet to the delivery address (items bought on best buy that told me that I could pick any day for delivery, which was not true). Their agent tracked my shipment but told me that he could not change the delivery date at that time as the items were currently being labeled. I stressed the urgency of the situation, telling him I don't live at that place yet, and could not afford to notify them of the change too late. He told me it's never too late as the driver can be notified at any time of the change. Delivery was not scheduled until June 25-27, so I had time to call them back and make the change. Today (June 19) I received an email notification that the items had been delivered! I totally panicked not knowing what had happened to my items. I had ordered 2 pieces of furniture, not just some small cheap item. Let me tell you what happened. The items were taken to the address where I don't live in (despite my communication with their agent less than 24h before), the current tenant not sure about what was going opened the door for them and they dumped the furniture at the lobby and then just left before he even had a chance to go downstairs and talk to them. Luckily for me he was kind enough to agree to keep the furniture in his apartment until I move in. Then the 2 of us had to transport more than 80lbs up to the 4th floor (no elevator in the building), risking to actually being injured, as the building management does not allow items left in the lobby.

710,ReviewRow-109,They suck,"Well here's one I don't like.

A few years back I had bought a used fish tank light on eBay. Had the guy put extra insurances on the shipping because of its fragile nature. Even paid for the packaging even had a picture of the receipt. ( or at least a quote for shipping packaging and insurance)

Long story short the light was late and damaged. Got ahold of ups and the shipper. Turns out they didn't put the extra insurance on. Buddy had a friend in the ups store I'm guessing.

I phoned ups store manager and explained the situation. They felt bad and offered to pay the shipping back. Not the insurance cause it was never paid he said. Even though I paid extra for it. So after a few months and various long didstabnce phone calls he tells me he's issued a cheque and it's in the mail. Waited a couple more weeks no cheque. Called back they said it has been received and cashed...

They sent out a cheque to the original guy that shipped it. After all the calls we were on a first name basis.

So now not only did I get screwed on the shipping and extra insurance. I've just spent a couple of months to give the ass that did this more money.

Called ups again. They said to get ahold of the original shipper. Did that he said thanks for the extra money and that he was broke so would not be writing a cheque to me ever.

Called ups again they said sorry.

719,ReviewRow-121,Update on my package left at my door!,"As I mentioned before, I ordered a expensive jacket online, then had a family emergency out of town. So I put a hold on any package delivery from UPS from 3/21/2019 to 3/25/2019, received an mail from UPS that the hold was placed with new delivery date of 3/26/2019. UPS delivered my expensive jacket on 3/22/2019.

Update part: I got home from my out of town emergency. Guess what? My expensive jacket(package) was gone. Of course it was gone, I live in a apartment complex. Who ever took my $400 plus jacket, I hope Karma gets them back one day. I had ready started talking to UPS the day I got a notification that my package was delivered even though I put a hold on it not be be delivered.

UPS is telling me to call the shipper. What does the shipper have to due with it? The shipper(evo) did their part, they packaged up my jacket and gave it to UPS to deliver it to the customer(me). My package was sent by what is known as UPS SurePost. I had never hear of this, and had to look it up. UPS SurePost is a package starts out with UPS than the package gets transferred to USPS for delivery. But UPS didn't transfer my package to USPS and UPS delivered my package even though I had put a hold on it to not be delivered. If UPS had transferred the my package to USPS my expensive jacket would of been safe and sound at my apartment office until I got home, because USPS doesn't delivery to people front doors in apartment complex's.

So UPS ignored my hold, didn't transfer my package to USPS, left my package at my front door in a apartment complex and now it's gone. All UPS is saying is to call the shipper(evo). UPS is not taking responsibility for my stolen package. The shipper(evo) in trusted UPS to deliver the package to the customer(me). My front door is not a customer. My front door didn't pay for the delivery. The only responsibility my front door has is to keep unwanted people out of my apartment. The shipper(evo) is not at fault, they did there part, UPS failed to do their part.

The jacket which was a Patagonia Powder Bowl Gore Tex Ski Jacket, can't be replaced. I literally bought the last in my size and the color I wanted. Patagonia is out of stock, same with REI, Backcountry, St. Bernard's etc. I search online for 3 weeks looking for this jacket, I called every ski shop in the country looking for this jacket. Finally I found it at evo. I didn't hesitate, I bought it and my 3 week search was over.

I'm mad as mad could be. Evo gave me a refund, but I think UPS should pay for it. UPS are the ones who cause my package to get stolen, by ignoring the hold, and not transferring my package to USPS.

UPS has single handedly created the front door Theft Industry by leaving peoples packages at customers front doors. I'm thinking a Class Action Lawsuit needs to happen. When a customer pays for shipping, the shipping company needs to deliver to the customer. If the customer is not home, leave a note, not the package. UPS is greedy, they need to hire more people to handle the online shopping boom. But nope, it's cheaper, faster for UPS to drop packages at people front door then doing the right thing by keeping people packages safe.

723,ReviewRow-189,Made me do their job,"I sent a product I had purchased back to the company it was from (it had broken as was eligible for a replacement due to the warranty). This was the second time this company had delivered via UPS, and it went the same way as last time. I was home all day - never heard a peep from the doorbell or a sound from the knocker; I had been up since 6AM. Assuming they hadn't rung the doorbell and placed it in my porch I went to check: in the place where I assumed my package would be I found a ""Sorry we missed you"" slip. The slip indicated that no attempt was made and the sheet's tick boxes remained un-checked (this meant that some key details were unknown due to poor work or lack of effort). 

So know we come into the second part of this delivery dilemma: when attempting to collect my package I had to bust open google maps because the ""UPS Access Point"" was not marked in any shape for form on the small convenience store. I am 17 and am in collage in England (this is an important detail for in a second) when attempting to pick up my package after handing the owner the slip of paper (""Sorry we missed you"") he asked me for ID. I do not own a drivers licence so I gave him my zip card which confirms my name and age. This plus the sheet is not enough apparently to receive the package as ""it didn't prove your address"". I have ID with my address on so for all intensive purposes I am now COMPLETELY unable to pick up my delivery. Thankfully I am able to have my parent pick it up, but if she didn't have a driver licence this would get far more complicated - and most definitely more complex and arduous than picking up a delivery that someone couldn't be bothered to do (note I was home the whole day and constantly listening for a ring or a knock, clearly showing they sent it to the ""UPS Access Point"" before posting the slip into my porch). I do not understand why the customer(I actually funded this catastrophe) is not able to pick up the delivery  with a valid ID (not all ID has address) and the missed slip; this would prove that the name of the person would match that on the parcel and that they had received the slip from their address. Doubters may say ""what if someone stole the slip""and, to that I remind you this whole system revolves around you supposedly not collecting the item - this means that they would leave the slip somewhere you would find it safe. Like the porch which is un-locked (there's a second door after that, think like an airlock), so for them not to use the slip as a valid document for collection either means they cannot be bothered to scan the unique QR code. Or more likely the slip is redundant and for whatever reason does not prove it's your address (even though your literal address is the first thing written on the slip).

They make up their own dates concerning when picking up from the shipper and dates of delivery. Three to five days for delivery, they run 24 hours and everyone is aware of this, do I bug them about a package past eight pm, no because that is not business hours but the trucks run day&night and lie to people t hat they dont.

Both the shipper and UPS have all the power to help customers but outright refuse and having the proof of their refusal have the nerve to deny they are refusing to help their paying customers.

749,ReviewRow-112,Word to the Wise- Don't pay in advance!,"I know UPS deliveries always have customs charges and broker charges so I was expecting the bill when I got it.

What I wasn't expecting was that I would pay the customs charges when I got my delivery notification 24 hours in advance only to have the driver refuse to give the package without payment. I was away from the house and my mother paid the charges a second time not realizing I had already done so.

When I called UPS they said it can take up to 24 hours a driver to be made aware of a payment (which is ridiculous given they we only get notified of a delivery the day before it arrives!).

I asked to speak with a supervisor, Edward, who said he couldn't do anything either because they can't cancel the transaction even though I called them the same day and the driver hadn't even gotten back to the office with my mother's information. He said they had to charge the card and generate an invoice, which would take 7-10 business days, and then would refund me.

I called again asking to speak with their accounting department so that they could make sure not to process the card at all but they refused to forward me because Customer Service is the ""right department to speak to on this issue"".

I am EXTREMELY disappointed in how this was handled. Their company made a mistake and uses some sort of archaic notification system and would not fix the mistake before it could escalate.

From what I could gather this is not an isolated incident and happens fairly often. Which is even more disappointing that they are willing to take multiple payments for one transaction, just to sit on the money, gain some interest and then refund people.

My mother and I also tried to contact both credit card companies to have one of the transactions blocked or cancelled but they said we had to call UPS. I actually called a third time and the HUNG UP on me while I was on hold!

I also contact the supplier of my product and recommended they change carriers to avoid inconveniencing future clients.

754,ReviewRow-85,WORST COMPANY EVER!,"""To everyone who is thinking of using UPS,
Please don't. Spare yourself time and effort and go with another delivery company.
Using UPS is thus far the worst customer service experience I have ever received.
Not only they have lost my bike during the transport from one depo to another, it has taken 4 weeks to officially' find my package which has been known for all this time that the package was at the another depo.
I felt like it was left up to me to find the bike that UPS has lost!
Not only were the staff I spoke to unhelpful, but to be frank they were lazy and not very resourceful. All they appeared to be doing is shifting the blame from one person to another, and even worse, to a third party. I was not aware this third party until I was told my bike was lost. After several weeks of this ordeal, once the bike had been delivered it was damaged to the point where it could not even be ridden. I was told yesterday that by UPS that someone will be following up on my case. Obviously this has not happened and once again I need to continue my battle with UPS to receive compensation for my damaged goods.
I haven't mentioned before that the once bike was delivered, the package was half ripped and partially opened.
After having the worst experience of my life, I wanted to see whether my case was a one off'. It appears as though UPS is flooded with the bad comments about the service they provide.
It seems quite common that they rarely fulfil their contractual obligations.
Therefore, I would strongly suggest to everyone who is thinking of using UPS, to think twice and go with another delivery company.
Safe to say that none of my friends or work colleagues who either used UPS in the past, or were thinking of using them, won't be doing that anymore.
I hope that this comment will help you avoid going through the same ordeal as I have gone through.

761,ReviewRow-57,20+ years of UGH just got worse,"For the better part of twenty years most of my deliveries came via UPS. For the most part they actually arrived and were dumped (not placed, just dropped) at my door, and very often literally thrown up the stairs to my second-story apartment, where they would usually land in front of somebody elses door or just in the middle of the hallway somewhere. Very often when this happened these deliveries would be visible from the outside of the building and I and my neighbors have actually seen these package being carried off by thieves, who would tear the boxes open behind the buildings, take the contents, and leave the remnants in the landscaping with recipients name and address clearly visible, which, adding insult to injury, would result in a fine by the homeowners association. Packages delivered like this often ended up breaking and/or spilling.
I have since moved from a major metropolitan area to a tiny university town. For several months I received my deliveries with no problems whatsoever. I noticed they were still thrown at my door, although the UPS truck can literally park 6-10 steps away from my front door.
Then the nightmare began.
My neighborhood appears to have gotten another driver, who seems to be incapable of actually delivering anything. It all started out innocently enough with a notice stuck on the door stating we missed you or whatever equivalent is actually stamped on these sticky notes. I thought it strange as three people including myself were home at the time and none of us heard a knock or the doorbell ring. Upon tracking the deliveries I found that they would be available for pickup several miles away the next day; the reason I have things delivered is because I am unable to pick stuff up anywhere as I am handicapped.
That first time I scheduled re-delivery which was not available that week but only the following Monday. Without notification, and only because I checked tracking, on Monday afternoon I discovered that the deliveries had been re-scheduled for that Thursday. Im getting increasingly annoyed at this continued demand for a presence at home when in the past all UPS ever did was throw packages at my door. When I call to complain or reschedule or anything at all I first have to wade through the user-unfriendly phone system every time which forces me to state a bunch of nonsense to actually get to a human being that is invariably rude and unhelpful. It was made clear that delivery is now dependent on discretion of the driver as to whether the area is unsafe, the package may get wet, depending on the value of the package, blah blah blah insert excuse here - since when has anybody ever given a rats patootie, please just keep on throwing stuff at my door, for crying out loud. If I wanted or expected to sign for a package it would not be for anything sent via UPS.
Subsequently I have continued to find notices stuck on my door and not one single package has actually been delivered for some six weeks now. Most times there has actually been someone at home, myself included, and neither I nor anybody else ever recalled having heard a knock or the doorbell ring. We all thought we were losing our minds till I started looking for reviews and found that it is apparently quite common now for UPS carriers to sneak up and leave notices and not actually deliver. I dont understand why; it takes more time and effort to write out a notice and sneak up to the door and stick it on the door than just dropping the package or just throwing it at the door. The latest problem UPS has begun to cause me is that due to being unable to deliver my packages after however many random attempts, my stuff gets returned to sender but I am unable to track it beyond being sent back to whatever UPS hub signed for it, so Im running into a lot of trouble getting my money refunded because the sender never gets it back.
I have no problem with UPS drivers using their discretion but for heavens sake knock on the door or ring the doorbell or blow the horn or do something besides blinking to alert us to your presence.
I have cancelled orders that are due to be shipped via UPS and will no longer purchase from otherwise useful sites like Amazon. There is absolutely nowhere to complain about this thoroughly lousy service and I have had enough.
September 2018: unfortunately it is impossible to not use UPS. After a few months of lousy service things stabilized a bit and there were not too many issues. Of course, that couldn't last. Last week a package was delivered several days before it was expected; the recipient was unavailable but as it happened, I was. This was not as good as it might appear; I am handicapped and it took a tremendous effort for me to get to the door, and after signing for a box (with cleaning supplies, why was a signature even necessary?) the driver tries to hand me a very heavy box which I had to request be placed on the floor. I asked if there was anything else and was told there was not.
Later there's a we missed you note stuck on the door. WTH? I was home. Instructions were left to pick package up at UPS store. WE HAVE THINGS DELIVERED BECAUSE WE ARE UNABLE TO GO TO THE STORE. ARGH! We were told that driver did not see a car in front of the home and assumed nobody was at home. Recipient managed to get a ride to the store several days later AND THE PACKAGE WAS NOT THERE. Store attendant could not find package and unsuccessfully tried to contact driver for the delivery area. It is now more than a week since package was supposedly left at UPS store but it has completely disappeared, tracking shows it is still out for delivery.","February 12th, 2018",5,18,Timmy G.,1.0,2021-05-30 12:37:07.924258,2021-05-30 12:37:11.140410,UPS,Sitejabber

Now almost a year later they have yet to replace the line, pole and fix the shed. So since then we've been forced to use our dryer for everything. Well guess what with 2 patents and 2 children it adds up. Hydro should be covered at your expence being you guys wanna waste months on doing nothing. What is going to be done about this? Cause all she does is drag it on and ignore.
*******@crawco.ca

And now after 10months of having to use our dryer every time cause they keep dragging this on. Here's the reply I get. Even after the driver admitted it was his fault.

I have attached a final release in the amount of $480.25

The rationale for the payment is as follows.

Total cost to repair - $960.50

Less 50% depreciation as building and clothesline are over 5 years old

No increase for hydro

Total amount paid $480.25

Once the final release is signed and sent back to me via email I will be able to process the payment and send it to your address.

Went through the motions, paid & printed out the papers.
Prepared everything for pick up on the 2nd between 11-5pm.
I waited by the window, next to the buzzer, from about 10am. Nothing!
Around 6pm, on my way to work, i saw a we missed you card waiting for me.

My postbox is INSIDE the building So how did the driver get into the building but not use my buzzer?
(Its a 4 flat building w/ individual numbers AND an all day service button. Check image)

I called TransGlobal for answers, they looked for every excuse in the book as to the failed pick up, followed by calling UPS, who claimed the driver buzzed, etc. Complete lies!

They offered to come back the next to pick up.

So on the 3rd; i waited in the same position at the same time Nothing.

After a few hours, i called TransGlobal, who had nothing productive to say but gave my number to UPS, who called to saying the driver supposedly came but no one was in I was HOME.
I explained what happened the day before & he reassured me the driver would return the same day & claimed that he would give my number directly to the driver to call me. Not surprisingly, more lies. A complete joke!

I cancelled the order. If UPS cant handle picking up a parcel, how can they handle shipping it across the world.

Took my business to IPostParcel (they use DHL), whos online service was easier; they came the next day (5th) no issues whatsoever & on the 9th (2 working days), it was at its destination.

I contacted UPS to enquire as to how a multibillion £ company cant handle a single package & gave them a few days to respond.
Not surprisingly, no results.

I have wasted my time, effort & resources trying to use their service & ive lost out.

I specified in writing a delivery time via the UPS online system. Despite this, UPS tried to deliver the parcel after, not before, 2 PM.

I called the number on the UPS InfoNotice left in my postbox, and was charged extra for calling a special charges number. But it was an answering machine stating UPS had changed their number, and to call another number, for which I was charged again, obviously.

According to the UPS website, I am to ""use this InfoNotice to tell the driver what I want to do with the package"" and ""place it back in the same location where the driver originally left it"" (!). Back into my personal postbox, lol? How long is it going to take before the driver finds it there, lol?

I called UPS and was told they won't deliver before 2 PM, on any day, even though their working hours are 9 AM-7 PM. So, I had to collect the parcel the following morning from their depot in the outskirts of the city. When I said that I had paid for fastest delivery option, I was also told I *HAD NOT PAID* for the fastest delivery option (!).

Within seconds of reading the above, the business card company issued me with a refund via PayPal for delivery.

On June 27,2016 I shipped a large package to New Jersey. It was in factory pack with pictures to validate the packaging; there is no way the item should have been damaged through simple shipping. When it arrived at the customer's residence, the box had been opened, the collector item Disney Big Fig had been removed and the chain to his watch broken, then put back in the box and delivered. The customer and I examined the evidence and concluded that an agent/employee/representative of UPS had in fact removed or cut through three strips of shipping tape and in a criminal act, damaged the product. It had been resealed with ""one"" piece of tape!

A claim was immediately made with UPS before the item left the customer's custody. UPS picked it up and did an ""investigation"" upon which they denied the claim immediately. This seems to be their pattern as well. I am fighting this denial since I am now stuck with a collector item that has lost all its value due to unlawful, criminal actions by the employees/agents/representatives of UPS. I have made an allegation of fraud which was dealt with by a phone call on a ""Saturday"" to my business at 8:36 a.m. (the business opens at 10:00 a.m.) with a return number stating they are not available on the weekends! At this writing, I still have not received legitimate response.

It is clear that UPS, a Union organization, does not feel it has to answer to its customers, is not a trustworthy or competent shipper. I strongly suggest you not trust your important shipments to this corporate beast.

777,ReviewRow-25,Got Lost Looking For Thier Own Hqs City,"How could UPS get lost looking for Louisville Kentucky of all places? Louisville is their largest hub location AND their corporate headquarters!

Apparently Big Brown has some really smart package handlers and OTR truck drivers when they can take a package addressed to LOUISVILLE KY and manage to route it to Madison Heights, Michigan before anyone anywhere in the system notices anything is wrong! No one noticed when it didn't arrive at the Louisville hub by midnight the day it was supposed to go out for delivery in the morning. In fact, no one noticed at all until it was scanned in at the hub in Michigan on the same afternoon that it was supposed to be delivered in Louisville. (I guess you could say that their computer noticed it wasn't in Louisville on time, because their computer put two totally fake ""scan"" records into the so-called tracking data pretending that the package was in Louisville, right before it magically appeared in Madison Heights, Michigan.)

Then when I called to ask where my package was after it was supposed to have been delivered first the ""Princess"" at UPS so-called Customer Service tells him there is no information available and no one knows if or when the package might be delivered. (And, no, I'm not being sarcastic, ""Princess"" is exactly what she called herself - and apparently what she thought she was.)

I asked for a supervisor and after 8 minutes on hold Princess is back to tell me the supervisor won't talk to you but that your package SHOULD be delivered on Monday.

I insisted on speaking to a supervisor and spent 14 more minutes on hold before someone came on the line obviously surprised that I was still there, with the standard ""I apologize for any inconvenience"" and assurances that UPS will TRY to get the package to Louisville by Monday.

I asked why they can't deliver it tomorrow and I got to spend 9 more minutes on hold only to be told that the hub in Michigan has ""already started sorting"" and can't be bothered looking for one package to upgrade but that coming from Michigan the package probably won't really get here on Monday anyway and that Tuesday is probably the best that UPS can do.

I should point out that Madison Heights, Michigan is less than a six hour drive to Louisville via your choice of two different Interstate highways - but it is taking UPS four days to make that 378 mile trip - in part because they needed to unload and reload the package at two extra stops in Maumee, Ohio and Sharonville, Oio along the way -- but mostly because UPS does not see this is a package where they made a mistake and need to work to fix the problem, but instead they see it as a package where they have an excuse to take their time because once its late no one cares how much later it gets.","August 1st, 2016",1,36,Tom C.,1.0,2021-05-30 12:38:04.996026,2021-05-30 12:38:08.229615,UPS,Sitejabber

I ordered a bed frame from Wayfair which is great! Unfortunately they use UPS as their shipping company. I was told my package would be delivered on November 27. My sisters death anniversary falls on the same day. I called UPS and asked if it could be pushed back to the 28th of Nov... they SAID NO it had to be the 27. They also couldn't provide a three or four hour window in which the delivery would take place. They said between 9am to 8pm because of this i didn't get a chance to visit my brother or even go visit the accident site on that day. By the time 9 pm rolled around NO delivery! A lady from the local shipping facility (steeles location toronto Canada) Who had (had a Caribbean accent didn't get her name) called the morning of the 28th. She was EXTREMELY RUDE! Which to me is Disgusting considering the situation... I was told by this lady the bed was never on the truck the day before! WHAT? I was told four times by UPS the day before this was out for delivery? Of course I was SOOOO MADDD to say the least and she hung up on me. You cant call the office back so at this point I don't know where the bed is. I call Wayfar, I spoke with a very nice lady who refunded me 50% of my order (which was nice) she also called UPS and they confirmed my bed would be delivered between 3pm and 7 pm... well 7pm rolled around and guess what NO BED! I call wayfair back and the man who answers this time calls UPS himself while im on hold and guess what? He comes back and tells me that UPS wouldn't be delivering this for another 2 days! WTH! And while i am having this conversation the UPS man shows up at my door with my bed! SO there seems to be ZERO communication between the local shipping office and the clients.

780,ReviewRow-23,May UPS Go Out of Business,"One of the truly magnificent days in the life of an author, after months and months of writing, more months of production, and then months of waiting, comes when your new books are finally ready to be shipped from the publishers warehouse.

Publishers know how to ship books so that they will arrive in good condition. So your author copies, in pristine condition, are carefully packed at the warehouse. Sometimes, they travel thousands of miles, from one stop to the next, magically making their way, ultimately, to your destination.

From Delight to Fright
As an author of several dozen books, I've had the pleasure of experiencing the delight in opening a box of my latest books and holding a copy in my hands for the first time. This experience seldom happens, however, when UPS is the carrier of record. UPS seems predisposed to hiring aggressive, angry, ineffective delivery men. I say men, because this has never happened with female delivery personnel.

As far as the book boxes might have traveled, and as many places as they might have rested, when the packages are ready to be delivered to my door step, here's what invariably happens: The UPS man takes a box out of the truck, strides up my sidewalk, and then, instead of walking up the two steps of my porch and laying the package down, he throws it. In throwing the package he saves perhaps two tenths of a second.

Perilous Odds
When the book boxes are thrown, if they fall flat the odds are that there will be no damage to any of the books. If one corner of the box, however strikes the flat cement of my porch first, then the books in that corner of the box are going to be damaged. In other words, brand new books, in pristine condition, that I have waited months to receive, and which have been shipped thousands of miles across the country, are now irrevocably damaged on the last. 01% of the trip because UPS hires hostile, angry orangutans... oos, delivery professionals who behave like orangutans.

I have chased such delivery men, after seeing what they've done to my book boxes. I have called UPS incessantly. I have complained at the local, regional, and national level. Each time I am told by UPS year after year that theyll look into this situation. Yet, as months pass, and other boxes of books arrive via UPS, I receive boxes in damaged condition as a result of the last second in the delivery process.

A UPS Handler Confesses
Confirming what I already knew to be true, an ex-UPS handler anonymously went on record in a national magazine, and exposed the horrors of the companys delivery system. For example, it is par for the course when boxes arrive squished or bent out of shape. Such packages move along a slide with hundreds of other packages and eventually are crushed from behind. Also heavier packages can slide on top of other packages, and the ones below can burst open.

On a drivers typical day, he will stand on one package to reach another. Submit a damage claim and often you will be denied because the tape you used on the box wasnt wide enough. In fact, if you don't prepare your vital packages precisely in accordance with UPS delivery rules then you have no claim. Fair enough, but this hasn't been the issue in sending or receiving packages. My publishers and I are aware of the regulations. That doesn't stop the flow of damaged boxes courtesy of the UPS.

Unbeknownst to almost any layperson, the UPS trailers in which their boxes sit could have holes along the roof. When it rains, boxes can get wet. The drivers know this but in their haste to make their daily deliveries, they do not stop and file the necessary paperwork to have their trucks repaired.

Any Old Way
Shipping something during the holidays? Shipper beware! UPS, like other delivery services, hire legions of seasonal packagers. Such workers are under-skilled, often exhausted, and pre-disposed to handle your box any old way, never mind if it's upright or getting crushed.

Don't bother to write fragile on your package. Handlers might encounter several hundred such packages during their shift. No one cares what you write on the side of the box. In one instance, the supervisor of a UPS newbie illustrated how to load a package on the truck. The supervisor picked up a small package and tossed on to the top of the stack of boxes. Unfortunately he missed and the box crashed on the trailer floor, whereupon he re-tossed it back up. Amazingly to the newbie, the box said fragile. The supervisor saw the newbies sense of alarm and said, they all say fragile.

What does work? Having a child-like drawing on your box! No handler is going to risk having a package, sent by some child, becoming all mashed up. Short of that, youre playing Russian roulette with packages every time you interact with the

781,ReviewRow-15,I cannot say enough bad things about UPS,"I cannot say enough bad things about UPS. Every single one of my deliveries has a problem. In the last week alone, I've had three packages trying to be delivered. (1) Delivered to the wrong address, about half a mile away (thank goodness it was a dude who doesn't like designer purses); (2) A package that can ONLY be delivered to my address, for signature, by UPS... who of course doesn't deliver on Saturdays, and I have this problem called a JOB. The biggest issue? Get this. The package can't even be picked up at the UPS warehouse (supposedly because that's the ""box"" the ""shipper checked,"" however come to find out that this is what UPS REQUIRES the shipper to do, to use them, under contract; (3) Yet another package that they've been trying to deliver, during the week, during working hours. Customer service told me to go to the warehouse by 7:30 p.m. I did. It was a 35-40 minute drive. I get there well before that time. But, guess what? The package has been ""put back in the trailer"" and can't come out. But hey... I can come back again the next day! How nice of them.

The biggest issue I have with UPS is their crappy customer service. They literally DO NOT CARE that you are inconvenienced. If you happen to have a job and can't be there during working hours. On weekdays, well, they'll deliver it somewhere else... for a $15 fee. True story.

Oh, and my favorite part? The long holds. The other day, when I called and we figured out that I couldn't pick up my package, but they couldn't deliver it (because I would never be home when their driver came), AND they couldn't deliver it to me at work or anywhere else... I asked the CS guy what he thought I should do. He said he didn't know. I asked to speak with a supervisor. He told me, ""The supervisor won't be able to help."" Well, call me silly, but I think that's why they're supervisors. Sometimes. They can.

But again, silly me. Shoulda listened. The supervisor couldn't help. Why? Because I was on hold for 38 minutes and the supervisor never picked up. I finally hung up, called the company and cancelled my checks.

I hate this company. Yet so many onlines businesses use it. I tell them to use FedEx, but somehow, UPS has a hold on most corporate retail companies. And it's a bloody nightmare.

I have no stock in FedEx and know no one who works there. I'm not biaised. I'm just saying, FedEx blows UPS out of the water, when it comes to customer service. Personally, I think it's because UPS drivers are all union, and FedEx aren't. No matter how crappy they do their jobs, no one can fire them.

I am done this year with UPS- overnight a package that took over a week because they do not listen. I requested a refund and that was supposed to be processed and it is not clear what if anything they did or did not do pursuant to bad record keeping. UPS Delivered my package to wrong address no matter how many times they are given a correct address. My choice often not working. USPS is far worse, and FEDEX is neck and neck to USPS.

806,ReviewRow-53,REALLY GREAT SERVICE FROM AN EMPLOYEE,"I WAS WAITING FOR MY TURN TO MAIL A LARGE PACKAGE SO I HAD A TIME
TO OBSERVE THE SERVICE OTHERS WERE GETTING.

ONE GIRL WAS A BRIGHT SHINNING STAR, IT WAS QUITE BUSY BUT SHE
TREATED EVERYONE LIKE THEY WERE HER FIRST CUSTOMERS OF THE DAY. SHE SMILED, HAD A GREAT VOICE AND WAS REALLY OUTSTANDING IN
HER TREATMENT OF THE CUSTOMERS. I TOLD HER I HAD WATCHED HER
AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE JOY IN WHICH APPROACHED EVERY
CUSTOMER WITH THIS CHEERY ATTITUDE, LIKE SHE WAS AS FRESH AS A
DAISY.

I OFFERED TO TALK TO HER SUPERVISOR ABOUT HER AND HOW ENGAGED
I WAS WATCHING AND LISTENING TO HER. SHE SAID INSTEAD I WAS TO
PUT THIS ON SITE JABBER INSTEAD, I AGREED, FIVE MONTHS AGO. WILL
LET HER KNOW TOMORROW OF THE FINALLY COMPLETING THIS TASK.

THERE HAPPENED TO BE MORE THAN ONE JASMINE AT THAT STORE AT THE
SAME TIME SO I AGREED TO PUT IN JASMINE T., TO MAKE THE REVIEW FIT
HER.

I AM A THERAPIST, SOMEONE USED TO MONITORING PEOPLE CLOSELY AND
BE ABLE TO ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE AND JASMINE WAS REALLY A
GREAT EXAMPLE TO HOW TO GO ABOUT YOUR DAILY WORK AND LEAVE ALL
FEELING GOOD ABOUT THEIR INTERACTION WITH HER. SHE DOES A GREAT
JOB, MUCH HIGHER THAN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ARE NORMALLY.
CONGRATULATIONS TO HER.
