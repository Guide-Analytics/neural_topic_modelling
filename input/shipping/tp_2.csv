Specifically speaking to our onboarding specialist and time period spent with Nicole, everything went really well. Nicole has a very professional yet laid back demeanor that was really helpful with setting everything up. Customer support has always been a bit of a challenge trying to get ahold of someone to fix issues. Calling is the only way that I can seem to get anything done, if we can get ahold of anyone. Emailing takes too long because they rarely understand the issue at hand in the initial email. This leads to multiple emails of explanation when the issue needs to be resolved faster. The warehouse is also a challenge. I have had WRO's broken and discarded before I could make a claim with my insurance company.

Not an honest company to work with.,US,"I wanted to do a test run with them so I sent them a few boxes of items (1/4 of a pallet, stationery products). After a month, our warehousing fees were around $2200. After trying to figure out with them how it got there, a month had gone by and it currently stands at $3700.

If you're wondering how it got that high, it's because they store your items based on how they can profit as much as they can from you. Keep in mind my products are stationery/office supplies, so you have stickers, tapes, notebooks, pens, etc. Storing them myself, I would've used 1-2 standard shelf space (items unpacked, obviously).

So where are they storing my items? They are being kept in 339 bins, 2 shelves, and 1 pallet. At the time of writing, bins are $5 each, shelves $10 each, and pallets $40. That's a total of about $1750 per month. How the flying dutchman do you store 1/4 pallet of things in all those places?

If you read their support pages, it says their staff are trained to store in a way that would be as efficient as possible to save the customer money. False. They are trained to do the opposite.

You cannot request them to store your items in a certain way either, so it means that they decide how much to charge you on warehousing. How convenient.

All in all, I only lost a few hundred dollars and some time. I'm here thinking maybe working with any other reputable fulfilment centers would've been better.

Despite what others have said here on the reviews, I went ahead and tried anyway. Turns out it's just as bad as they say. If you value your time, look elsewhere.",2020-12-04T08:44:23.000Z,1,3,Aki,1.0,2021-05-28 13:15:22.575368,2021-05-28 13:15:26.921262,ShipBob,Trustpilot

With me, Shipbob never made a single delivery on schedule this past year. I can understand that given the state of delays with this pandemic, but what I can't excuse is this: Shipbob was routinely over-reporting the amount of storage space required to warehouse my inventory, in order to charge me higher for storage costs.

When I cleared out my inventory to use another 3PL service, I decided to dispose of the inventory, and they charged me more on disposal than it would have cost me to ship my inventory internationally. Seriously deceptive stuff.

Claiming my inventory occupies way more space that is remotely believable - this is how they inflate their profits. Deceptive and unethical. Avoid at all costs.",2020-11-16T16:20:15.000Z,2,6,Khalid Hamadeh,1.0,2021-05-28 13:15:41.399719,2021-05-28 13:15:42.894665,ShipBob,Trustpilot

120,5f4bdf0702e8570814fc3090,"shipbob stole my inventory, and held on to the rest for over 2 weeks when I wanted to remove it from their warehouse.",US,"I’ve finally received my inventory and they basically dumped my products in a box with broken edges and a strip of tape. Some of the inventory is made of paper and now damaged! I didn’t think my experience could get any lower with shipbob but here we are.

Here’s snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect:

- Firstly, if I did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center, shipbob would’ve stopped my business for an entire month!
- shipbob stole some of my inventory. They claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesn’t know how to count. Not kidding! They said that sometimes they just count incorrectly. This was during a recorded call on August 14, 2020 (mentioning dates cause they love to contact Trustpilot denying their incompetence).
- I requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless they’ve handled it, I doubt that is gonna happen.
- I asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because I absolutely no longer trust them. They denied the request. I was correct.
- Hidden fees! They told me kitting would cost $1.10 per item and charged me $2.50 without informing me of the cost change. When I asked about this - no response! (email from August 21, 2020)
- Customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss.
- Your emails will be ignored.
- Your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up. They won’t.
- You will spend many, many, many hours calling and emailing, asking people to do their job.
- Your orders will not be sent out on time.
- Your kitting will never be ready on time.
- I was going to do a pre-order sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 (F I V E) orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship FIVE orders.
- When I brought up how awful their service is I was told that, “as we work with over 4,000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time”. ( email from Aug 14, 2020) Sooo am I automatically just part of the ‘whatever, this happens group’!?!? Will YOU be part of that group?
- You have to pay $500 for an “implementation specialist” who will respond (maybe/if they feel like it) days later with no solution to your problem because they are ‘busy with [more important] back to back meetings' (email from Aug 3, 2020).
- Do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management’, it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call. They will do nothing.
- “Management” only shows up/is available for a call when you’ve voiced that you’re leaving the company.
- Once you speak with “management” you’ll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency.
- “Management” will have a call with you, and then ghost you. Literally never talk to you again.
- When I directly called them a scam (which they are) they informed me that one of their clients is Tom Brady (Instagram DM August 25, 2020). Still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me. Tom Brady...el-oh-el.
- Their 5-star reviews are clearly fake. They deleted mine and other negative comments on Instagram and have disabled reviews on Facebook (I reposted my IG comment). On Trustpilot, they always seem to receive sparkling 'reviews' right after an authentic negative review. And they’re constantly reporting reviews for ‘breaching guidelines’
Maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldn’t have to spend time making up and disputing reviews.

shipbob is a scam. Avoid.

***Do your research!***
- Read the real reviews not the bots.
- Read the real blog posts not the paid media articles.
- Read the comments that they keep deleting on their social media accounts.
- Reach out to others who have used shipbob and predictably no longer do.
- Do not be fooled by reports of growth and investors pouring money into the company.

Anyway, if you choose to still proceed, good luck, it will absolutely not end well.",2020-08-30T17:16:55.000Z,1,2,MM,1.0,2021-05-28 13:17:10.282230,2021-05-28 13:17:11.992432,ShipBob,Trustpilot

ShipBob's onboarding process with Taylor was fantastic and thorough. Their backend interface is very intuitive and allows us to have a lot of control over our fulfillment from holding orders to kitting.

I had a previously bad experience with a 3PL, so I felt a bit hesitant to sign up for ShipBob. Wow do I wish I'd listened to my gut. I have been lied to every step of the way. Emails to them go 24+ hours with no response.

Their dimensional pricing sounds fine, until you realize they do not care at all about what size box they use. We have a small item (<.1 cu ft) that can fit into a 7x7x3 box. Their team was putting it into HUGE boxes, and charging us dimensional pricing on their error. This is the difference between a ~$5 shipping charge and a $32 shipping charge. Now multiply that over hundreds of similar errors and suddenly our bill was out of control within the first two weeks. They've said ""we're definitely going to be refunding the difference"" but I still haven't seen a dime.

They claim that their SLAs got pushed back due to covid but ""99% are still fulfilled on time"". I have had may the inverse, 1% filled on time. Most are late to be fulfilled, late to deliver, and often ""reset"" their SLA with no reason given and nothing you can do to ask ""why""?

I have spoken to so many former customers that have had the same exact experience I have, and I can't understand how I didn't see it before I signed up.

Customer response times have gone from a few hours to one-three business days. Even when you get a response, it rarely gives you a way forward. Check-in emails asking about the same issue a few days in a row are now just being ignored.

Also, don't be fooled by SLAs.

Their sales team was phenomenal in selling me on a service that wasn’t delivered. Shipbob has had my product dimensions and weights incorrect in the system, driving my shipping costs way up! It took a month (yes, a full month!) to get the weights corrected and I’m still waiting to be reimbursed for all the overcharges. While patiently waiting, the products went back to their incorrect weights in which I have to wait for their team to correct again. Because they contract out of a fulfillment center in Tampa (which by the way, no one told me - I had to Google the Tampa address), my weights will be incorrect for weeks because the communication between the companies is brutal. Also, the systems don’t integrate, so their pick error rate is much higher than in the contract I’ve signed. No one from customer service contacted me until I posted all over social media, and after that, I’ve received minimal follow up. Don’t be fooled by their sales team. Their social media leaves no room for reviews for a reason. Best of luck to anyone getting involved.

If you think rental car agencies are the best at hiding extra fees, you've never used ShipBob.

Ask a few other companies who use (or more likely used to use them) before you use them. Our experience was terrible and I feel cheated.

Their SLAs are sneaky and borderline deceitful compared to their sales pitch. You think they'll receive your inventory in at most 5 days because thats what they said? FALSE. They word it as such: ""5 business days once the WRO moved to ""Arrived"" status""

Guess who defines ""arrived""? That's right - ShipBob! Doesn't matter when it physically arrives, they are the ultimate word here. Its all in their writing so I guess I'm to blame, but never have I seen a spoken pitch differ so much from whats in a contract. Shameful, if you ask me.

That said, dont you dare mess up anything, they will charge you for it, and fail to properly notify you. $50 a day for improperly labeled arriving inventory yet not a single call or specific email!?

Shipbob is a hidden fee company parading as a 3PL.

If you dont believe me - try contacting them via phone. THERES NO NUMBER ON THEIR SITE - or at least I couldn't find one. Best part, they didn't actually answer it when I saw they were sending out the wrong packages. I left an urgent message saying they need to not send them and got a call back well into the next day.

210,5ebea35a25e5d20a88968b8c,Would give 0 stars if I could,US,"If you are looking for a fulfillment partner, ShipBob is a horrible option. In our experience... They lied about their rates and technological capabilities. They fought with us when we brought issues to their attention. Their failures resulted in hours and hours and hours of our time being devoted to something we thought we were outsourcing. Worst of all, we lost customers due to delayed orders and faulty tech related to shipping options.

We had significant issues with ShipBob since we very first began working with them, and every time one issue was solved, another occurred. Below are the issues we encountered, and based on other reviews and of their own admission, I know we are not the only company to face issues like these.

Fulfillment Center Issues:
- It is not uncommon for their fulfillment centers to sit on orders, causing delays, and then falsely claim such delays are carrier-related. This is true for regular ground orders in addition to expedited orders, and we lost several customers who paid for 2 day, 3 day, and overnight orders that were late because ShipBob delayed processing them. I should note that all orders I'm referring to met ShipBob's order import cutoff time deadlines.

- They unilaterally increased our box sizes without letting us know, which increased the cost of postage significantly. Our product fit in smaller, standard boxes they already had in stock. It was never explained why they made those changes. They eventually returned to the smaller box sizes and reimbursed us for the overcharges, but it was a major headache that took weeks to resolve.

- On more than one occasion, ShipBob sent our customers products from a different company who also used them for fulfillment, instead of sending our customers our products, which they ordered. I have no idea what happened to our inventory or whether they notified these other companies of this issue.

- It took them 6 weeks to process returns, and that is not an exaggeration. Meaning, if an item is returned to the FC, they notified us 6 weeks later that it was returned. Apparently they only decided to put a returns policy in place in Mid-March of this year, 6 years after opening their doors as a company.

Technology and Rate Issues:
- They bait-and-switched us on affordable 2 Day shipping. It took getting one of the company's founders involved for them to fulfill the promises they made, and contracted for, regarding giving our customers access to affordable 2 Day shipping.

- They consistently overcharged us for fulfillment, requiring us to do several audits and request credits for being overcharged. These exercises took hours and involved a lot of back-and-forth each time. In some cases, it wasn't until we threatened legal action that they credited us for these overcharges. Overall, we were credited several thousand dollars for overcharges, which is not insignificant.

- They offered us ""real time rates"" for overnight orders that were not actually tied to real time rates; it was a complete misnomer and false promise. This resulted in us under-charging customers and having to cover the difference, which turned profitable sales into losses.

- For a reason they still cannot explain, they removed all shipping options and rules, and instead put in place a $20 ground option (our product retails for $39.95 and weighs 6 ounces). Our conversion rate plummeted from 4.6% to 1.3% during the time that our shipping options were affected. We were not the only customer affected by this issue, and because ShipBob never got to the bottom of why it happened, they could not assure us it wouldn't happen again.

Issues Cancelling:
In the end, Shipbob reimbursed us for a lot, but not everything, and it took nearly 2 months for them to get us our final refund. When we expressed our desire to leave, their SVP of something set up a call, presumably to try and retain us, but then she missed our call and didn't reschedule.",2020-05-15T14:12:42.000Z,1,1,Rachel Kaplan,1.0,2021-05-28 13:21:00.664457,2021-05-28 13:21:00.980319,ShipBob,Trustpilot

It was next-to-impossible to find out what my shipment cost for a particular order was without combining data from up to four(!) spreadsheets that they'd mail me every week and waiting two weeks for the data to get to me. Yikes! By the time we found problems, it was too late to get things corrected without losing two weeks.

So we decided to change our D2C fulfillment to ShipBob. We got set up in a short period, were trained on the software, and had our hands held by a customer support rep for the first 30 days. Boy was that nice. And we could immediately see what a shipped order cost. We made some additional tweaks with that data in hand and never looked back.

It seems that ShipBob like to remove negative reviews of their company.

I would advise anyone considering fulfillment services to look else where. From my personal experience ShipBob have made multiple errors with shipping out my goods often charging $35+ to send out a simple product such as a cap. I have compiled all of the orders with incorrect postage and they refuse to make any refund to my account. They have recredited my account once for $22.

The account manager that signed my business up will not respond to any emails of which I have now sent 5 and since signing up my business to shipBob has shown no care or attention to the numerous issues I have incounterd with the business and instead I am left having to email a generic customer service account.

As a customer I understand that sometimes mistakes are made but my frustration is how the issues I have faced have been handled.

I’ve been with shipbob since they started. They simply grew too fast for their own good. I used to mostly ship out of their NY warehouse, but they lost probably at least 100 of my shipments, it started out as 1-2 lost packages a month. They were insured, but still. Last summer is where I started to lose it, literally and figuratively. They “misplaced” on the at least 2000-3000 thousand dollars worth of shipments in 6 weeks. Customer service was VERY unhelpful, they responded slowly each time I referenced the other 10 open tickets I had (they lost maybe 10 packages in 6 weeks), they always gave the same unhelpful, I didn't bother reading your email rote response. I was actually on a 3 week camping trip during most of this time and it was very stressful instead of being relaxing. One of my most popular products has been ""misplaced"" or flat out stolen from their warehouses. In this coronavirus day and age of lockdown, it's an exercise from home trainer. I just had 10 HUGE boxes of 10 shipped and signed for at their Bethlehem warehouse. The person who signed for it ""no longer works there"" All of a sudden in early March I got an out of stock notice and had sold 50 since Jan. I contacted support, and they didn't even bother replying saying that warehouse replied, saying ""they couldn't be found."" I paid over $800 to ship to shipbob and they are only reimbursing me for the cost of the items, but NOT the shipping. I implored both support and the higher up manager. The manager who reassured me so much during last's year's fiasco of lost shipments said I could contact him personally. He has also been now basically ignoring my emails and saying ""please contact support."" Thanks for nothing! To top it off, what would've been at least 2-3 months of high demand item is now out of stock for 4-5 weeks because that's how long it takes for new ones to be produced. Btw, shipbob's new reimbursement ""policy"" is to no longer reimburse for shipping when they lose an item. What happens is this, if they ship an item - it gets ""handed"" off to the carrier, but tracking never gets updated. You call the carrier and they say they never received it. Again, this used to happen once a month, but last summer it happened 10 times or more in 6 weeks - clearly things were getting stolen. So after that, I noticed the new ""policy"" not to reimburse for shipping YOU paid for, when shipbob clearly wraps up your product, charges you for it and someone steals it or throws it in the garbage.

228,5e6273153c93ae0bc4115083,I've waited before reviewing ShipBob,DE,"I've waited before reviewing ShipBob, as I think it's a great concept, but the last experience with them has really drawn the line.

We sent 50 pieces of one of our products to their Texas warehouse to test the ShipBob service, in the hope to store larger inventory and more products there. We currently have 2 warehouses in Europe, which we manage ourselves, and are familiar with shipping rates and fulfillment.

Now, before you get on, ShipBob says that the ""negotiated the best shipping rates so that you don't have to worry about it"". This sounds great, and honnestly, we are ready to pay a good amount for the service of fulfillment, however, it seems like there is no justification for their charges at all...

Our product is a medium-sized table lamp, packed in a parcel with the following dimensions: 20""x20""x20"", the products are all packed and ready to be shipped, absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item!

Now, the average fulfillment cost inside the US for these items is $150 per box! $150!!!???

However, the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in Texas, to a customer in Dallas, Texas. (This is a 4h driver from the warehouse). The shipping had been done with economy, ground shipping, and ShipBob charged us $80.63 for it! Now, for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates, how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it??

Just to give you an example: We send out chairs from our European warehouses to customers in Europe, these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp. A standard shipping fee for this, from Berlin to Spain is around 18€!!! Note that Berlin to Spain is a 24h drive...

But the reason why I am now writing this review is that we just had our first return. The fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $137,9, and now Shipbob charged us $93,6 for the return of this lamp!

That's a total of $231,5 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp!!!!

How on earth???

In our own warehouses in Europe, we have a flat return rate of 8€ small/medium items and 12€ for larger items, and I am sure that it's the same in the US, and am fairly convinced that it's even cheaper, as everything stays in the same country... But $93,6 for a single return of a medium-sized parcel???


I really didn't want to write this review, this is completely absurd... ShipBob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item, and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it...

There are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates, they charge over X10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is...

Just do the math for yourself, try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20""x20""x20"" and try to get it shipped from one city in Texas to another city in the same state, and then try to see how much shipping costs...

Or try to send the same 20""x20""x20"" parcel from Texas to NY including a return label, and try to justify the $231,5 charge!


Update: I thought it would be very interesting to add the following: Our offices are located in Berlin, Germany, and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices.

Shipping a single box the size of that table lamp that I mentioned in the review, costs us about $130 with the express, door to door, air shipping, from CHINA!

How on earth is it possible that Shipbob has rates that are higher for economy ground shipping within the US then express air shipping from China to Germany????

New update: This keeps on getting better! Shipbob shipped this table lamp to a client, and it arrived severely damaged! (Shipping cost from Texas to NY: $140), their response to this is that Shipbob ""does not take any responsibility for the damages"". WHAT?? For $140, there is no insurance included? And Shipbob, does not take any responsibility for damages? This means that we now need to return this lamp to Shipbob, for which they will charge us another $90!!!?? This is just the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with, and I am looking forward to our stock being over with them!

262,5de5c81cc8454509583d7116,I had used Shipbob for 3 years,AU,"I had used Shipbob for 3 years, and suffered far too long.

Initially they were ok to get my account going, but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent.

My company sells simple ecommerce products, often in multi-packs. Their TOTAL INABILITY to simply pack a 2-unit or 3-unit multi-pack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering.

I would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation, and it took hours before I even received a call back. And then ""that"" call was from a warehouse not involved in this order.

They routinely overcharge; orders are placed into OVERLY excessive packaging for one order, then into different ""appropriate"" packaging for the next, exact same order. At times I have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $5-6. This happened as often as not.

The web-interface is clunky and buggy.

Only just now has a ""merchant care"" telephone number been setup. It's hit or miss as to whether someone answers.

Emails requesting help, particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered, or if answered, then unresolved. Typical answer - That order was too long ago, we did an audit, but unfortunately we cannot refund your money.""

And then there is this doozy - Overcharging $1400, yes! USD $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money.

""We'll credit your account"" - they say. I don't want a credit, I want that money refunded. You don't keep 'my' money ahead of time. Shipbob messed up, Shipbob should refund. IMMEDIATELY.

""We are unable to refund your credit card"" they say (they are very quick to charge your credit card, but to say they can't reverse a charge - I smell BS.

""We'll look into this and get onto it as soon as possible"" - still 2-3 weeks later and NOT.ONE.WORD on refunding me my money.

This will have to be resolved through local police fraud department I believe.

SHIPBOB are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3-year loyal existing customer.
Happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so.
Reluctant to refund that money.

Flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs. This is theft.

Everyone, please, AT ALL COST - STAY AWAY FROM SHIPBOB.

Just.Stay.Away.

Shipbob simply are THAT bad.

UPDATE: It appears that any negative review of Shipbob is attempted to be taken down off Trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine. Trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with Shipbob. A number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother, which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing.

I took the time and submitted the info requested. I felt it necessary to warn others.

As you’ll see all the negative reviews are “verified customers.”

Now ask yourself, how many of the glowing 5-star reviews show “verified customer”?

It Could well be a case of fake 5-star reviews being uploaded. Trustpilot, you should require ALL REVIEWERS to be verified.

And finally this: when issues arise, and they do, frequently, the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email, let alone getting your issue resolved. They are VERY QUICK to ask you for a review and “tell us how we’re doing”

Well I am telling you how you’re doing. DISGRACEFUL.

That said, I hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using Shipbob.

The software is poorly designed, the customer support is worthless, and we were billed thousands more than we expected. Shipbob shouldn’t be trusted with your mission-critical fulfillment. The ""support"" team is pathetically incompetent and clueless.

I'll share just TWO of many horrible experiences. 1) We wanted a quote to move some inventory from Shipbob last year before the holidays. Their process for getting a quote is to create a shipping order and write ""DO NOT SHIP"" for each line in the address. We did that, but somehow they managed to ship our order instead of just giving us a quote. I don't know how, but they literally sent the order to the address ""DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP"". I don't know where the large shipment of boxes went, but it took about two months before Shitbob returned our inventory. Shipbob's mistake caused us to miss out on busiest shopping season of the year—the entire holiday season from Black Friday to Christmas! We lost a huge amount of revenue because Shipbob essentially disappear our inventory for nearly two months. Yet, Shipbob provided zero compensation to us for their mistake.

2) Recently I noticed charges on my credit card statement from Shipbob for $75 day-after-day, going back for months. I asked them what's going on, and they said they received a box with three books back on August 9th, and so they were billing us $25-per-book-per-day ($75 per day!) for storage on their dock because I didn't create a Warehouse Receiving Order for the items. We didn't ship this package to them. Apparently some third-party sent it. They send us one email about it, and then, without ever reaching out to us again or highlighting the issue on the web portal, they just billed us over $5,000 ($75 per day for more than two months)! Insane! This in akin to the worst kinds of predatory financial scams.

Shipbob: your customers need a fulfillment service we can depend on, but your service is extremely unreliable. I've been grossly overbilled, but you wouldn't acknowledge mistakes. And I have to write over-and-over-and-over again requesting help for the same issues because no one takes any real ownership or responsibility for seeing customer problems are resolved. Your reps only fire off a quick and useless reply leaving us frustrated and further damaging our business with fulfillment delays and canceled orders. Day-after-day-after-day, I'm spending way too many hours trying to make this work, and our business and customer are suffering from it. I'd rather spend my time growing my own business than wasting countless hours with your useless support team. These ongoing problems have delayed shipments by days and weeks cost us lost orders, creating irate customers, and damaging our relationships with partners like Amazon Advantage. It's so utterly frustrating sometimes I feel as if I'm going to have a heart attack.

I hate to disparage anyone's business, but you doing us a great disservice. Shipbob is ruining a small business we've been working on for 13 years. If you can't fix these problems for us ASAP, you should compensate us fully for the cost of moving our inventory elsewhere. We thought moving to Shipbob from Rakutensl (formerly Webgistix) was going to save us some money. We deeply regret our decision to use your service.

I've talked to the Shipbob leadership a few times about my issues, but there was no improvement. Clearly, they doesn't know how to create a great company. 1 in 5 Trustpilot reviewers give Shipbob the lowest possible score. Save yourself the trouble, and avoid these amateurs.

We have had a terrible experience working with ShipBob and would encourage other companies to avoid using them at all costs even if it means paying more for storage/fulfillment.

We have had errors/issues with ~20%+ of our shipments they have fulfilled. For context, we have a pretty straightforward fulfillment needs as we sell wholesale and so only need case picks. Despite this, the list of problems is never-ending, and includes but is not limited to, sending a single unit instead of a case, sending another company's inventory to our customers, not sending shipments out on time, sending shipments under the wrong shipping option (ex. Ground instead of expedited), overbilling for storage, unnecessarily repackaging or case-packed product, poor communication between customer service reps, and so on.

It is clear that there huge holes in their operations and procedures, and that despite months of problems, issues continue to occur. We have had to spend hours on the phone to get issues corrected and have almost lost customers due to the neverending shipping issues they have caused.

278,5d6ccefbf0186907108a9a4d,Nothing Compares! You Should Read This!,US,"This review is been long overdue, and you should probably read this review to the end, if you're considering doing business with ShipBob!

We partnered up with ShipBob early of 2018, to handle all of our ecommerce inventory management and fulfillment. we were mainly intrigued by their simple pricing structure and same day shipping option.

The decision to switch to ShipBob from a previous fulfillment provider was executed after extensive research at the time, as we've tried a couple different 3PL partners in the past that only led to issues.

From week 1 of working with ShipBob, we started noticing that orders were being shipped as promised, their basic 3-7 day shipping option didn't disappoint as it was quick enough for our intended purpose and shipping rate structures, I would say in 8 out of 10 times, orders were and are still being delivered in under or around 4 days on average from ordering to delivery.

Their web interface is super friendly and easy to use, and their API integrates flawlessly with our shopify store.

Their email support is super prompt and thoroughly professional

All was going great up until we started seeing in their email newsletter early this year (2019) that they're expanding their operation, and this is when things got a bit rocky. all of the sudden the cost per shipment skyrocketed and it was very inconsistent and totally unpredictable.

After numerous attempts to understand what was happening and trying to find a fast resolution, it took some time to get clarity on the situation as we finally learned that they invested in newer tools and introduced state of the art scanning and weighing technology (similar to amazon robots) which should've been a ""Pro"" but it wasn't in beginning as there was apparently a learning curve to this new technology!

So let me give you a bit more context on what exactly was happening and what that scanning technology was supposed to do. I believe it's called ""Cubiscan"", which is a 3D robotic system that is intended to streamline the fulfillment operation by accurately scanning and weighting any given SKU within the system to be able to give the human picker/packer efficient and accurate data on what is the best and most cost effective shipping label and box size to use when shipping a given order based on its quantity, dimensions and shipping destination! This was obviously designed to make the shipping process faster, cheaper and more accurate.

Sounds good, right? we thought so too! but the issue that when they implemented this system, it required all the vendors (people like you and me) to update the nature of their products within the system, to basically tell this robot if the product being shipped was fragile, stackable, foldable or if it required a custom / special box, etc..

This was obviously in place to save on ""Dimensional Weight"" in our favor, which is the key metric that determines the cost per shipment with any shipping carrier.

And while this should've been a simple and easy task, it led to lots of inconsistency and higher shipping charges in the beginning, simply due to the fact that we didn't really know or understood what it all meant and how it would affect the shipping rate!

And so of-course as any wise brand would do, we marked every possible secure/fancy option (none stackable, fragile, custom box) not knowing that this would translate into empty space within any given shipping box, which means, that if we were shipping a product that is 12x12x12 for example, that it would require a much larger shipping box to accommodate the preferences we selected and allow room for lots of packing / padding material! But bigger box simply means higher cost in the shipping label! So you can only imagine what it would be like if were shipping 2, 3 or more items at once, which is typically how we market our products and incentivize the shopper to buy more for the sake of AOV!

This understanding of the issue, came a bit late aftersome frustration and almost having to walk away from ShipBob altogether (Im So Glad We Did Not) as Dhruv ""Co-Founders of ShipBob"" reached out to us personally in his attempt to help us understand the situation and change our recent experience, and I must admit that I was blown away by his level of dedication, courtesy and professionalism along with his team to get us back on track and rebuild our trust and confidence level once again.

Dhruv worked tirelessly and seemed to have our best interest at heart (which is extremely rare to find these days), not once has he denied the issue or tried to sugarcoat it, he knew what was wrong, took the time to explain it to us and quickly executed a recovery plan to get back on track.

He attended to every scheduled call with positive “can do” attitude, gave us his undivided attention throughout the process and kept us updated along the way. He also took ownership of the overcharges that were a consequence of the above mentioned issues, which some may argue that was the right thing to do, but honestly this was an error on both parties ""us and them"" being that we went overboard with our box and packing preferences not knowing what it would do! An honorable and a big move on his end in my opinion that many choose to look the other way and neglect!

In my 18+ years of entrepreneurship and the number of entities I was a part of building, establishing and operating, I haven't seen many like him, which not only resulted in fixing our problems, it also gave us the confidence that we were in good hands moving forward! Because by the end of the day, nothing and no one is perfect and issues as well as mishaps do rise and come up in every business model, it's part of growing, and as a private brand, we ourselves had our own fair share of trials and errors and that's how we all learn and evolve! The most important part is learning from the mistakes and working hard on recovering from them, and Dhruv as a the face of the company, truly demonstrated his abilities of caring and recovering from any issue no matter how messy it can be.

He also put his team on our account ""Voluntarily"" to perform a full audit and was happy to compensate us for any overcharges that occured during that period

Its now been over 3 months since this issue was resolved, and everything seems to be moving like clockwork. Orders are shipped promptly and being delivered in a timely manner as promised.

Overall, I would absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend ShipBob to anyone looking for a reliable fulfillment PARTNER and ready to scale their ecommerce business. as they're now stronger than ever and will most definitely benefit your business now that they have every smart tool in the shed sharpened and ready to go in your favor while saving you time and money.

I contacted support through live chat. I had to ask them FOUR TIMES to delete my account. They said I wouldn't be contacted again. I was sent four emails asking for ""feedback.""

I was then contacted a day later by their business development manager wanting to know if Shipbob was the right company for my business. I asked him why I was being contacted, why he is still using my information after my account had been deleted, and asked for a link to their privacy policy and GDPR compliance. I haven't received a response.

This company is a joke. Do not deal with them.

UPDATE: July 6th Shipbob contacted me on Trustpilot, with the excuse that they ""just got access to this account, hence the delay"". They asked me to provide my ""real name and email address"" so they could look into this. This is outrageous, considering my original complaint was that they abused the data I provided when I signed up. These people continue to be a joke. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY BUSINESS.

ANOTHER UPDATE: Shipbob reported my review for being false, as they have done with several other one-star reviews. Trustpilot contacted me for proof of my interactions and I sent every shred of evidence I have including the chat logs I saved and their continuous spamming of my email address. These people will do whatever it takes to get bad reviews off this site. Most businesses concentrate on delivering excellent customer service, but these people just try to scrub the evidence from the internet.

PROSPECTIVE BUYERS, TAKE NOTE: Shipbob's recent 5-star reviews, which suddenly took them from a one-star to four-star company, are suspect: They are vague, unverified, and lack detail - classic hallmarks of fakery. They're also posted at regular intervals. Trustpilot should be monitoring this.

YET ANOTHER UPDATE: Shipbob, despite my review being verified by Trustpilot as true, reported my review. They also posted a taunting reply to my review, saying that they can't remove my data if I won't give them my email address (despite, as verified in the initial review, they abused my data when they should have removed it).
