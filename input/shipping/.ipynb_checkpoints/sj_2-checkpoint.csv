0,ReviewRow-788,Unbelievably awful,"Awful, awful experience. Paid for expedited shipping/Saturday delivery. Ordered item 8 days ago. Delivery date has been kicked back 3 times. The warehouse my package is at is 25 minutes away. In trying to call customer service to speak to an agent, the automated system won't let me even do that.

Take my money for an expedited shipping & then do as little as possible to see thru that obligation. That's what I'm getting here.

I will go out of my way to never use Fed Ex again.

1,ReviewRow-279,Half backwards Delivery company,"I have a package that is supposed to come from California to NY.
I'm trying to wrap my head around why the people running FedEx would send my package on its way out of California then abruptly stop it almost halfway across the country in Wyoming and then turn the package back to a different part of California only to let it sit idle for 3 days so they can repeat the process all over again.

2,ReviewRow-525,It is unbelievable that a shipment stays 18 days in the DUBAI Arab Emirates customs for any reason.,"Hi,

I didn't receive my shipment *******03749 yet. It is unbelievable that a shipment stays 18 days in the DUBAI Arab Emirates customs for any reason. FedEx was one day the best carrier on earth but now the worst one. They deliberately leave shipments to accumulate and pick them altogether. I hope you convey my message to them.

COVID doesn't stop a person from delivering a package. I would never use them again and they are no different from the lazy USPS who don't care.

I just received a package (today is Sunday) and that's definitely something USPS would not do. USPS has lost a lot of things that I have ordered as well as shipped and they never take the blame for any of it. Fedex has never lost anything I have ordered or shipped and they are FAST!

Obviously, they have lost the package, or it has been pilfered. Stolen. I insured only for $ 900, but computer cost $1,600!

I will have to have the buyer cancel the sale, and file a claim and see if I can get anything near what it cost me. Ebay, will still probably charge me a final value fee, and I will not be able to get a credit even though the sale will be canceled.

I've been a corporate customer of FEDEX for over 30 years, and I've never seen any company's service deteriorate so much in the past year.

No packages are delivered on time, in my experience, and this is the 2nd one for me that appears to be completely lost.

I was told I couldn't speak to a manager or supervisor on the phone (ON THE PHONE) because of the weather. Yea you read that correctly. The manger I did finally speak to was rude and very inconsiderate. She basically mocked me and said there was nothing she could do. Spend your money elsewhere. Save your time, money, and sanity and use UPS or USPS. FedEx is a joke of a company and I honestly don't understand how they are still in business because I see way more bad reviews than good.

I must say that I was one of the original employees back in 1973. We worked hard to build the company with our energy, ideas and performance. But the company today lacks the concern for doing the right thing for customers, and is full of arrogant, don't give-a-dam people. Companies that act this way are in decline, and their service reflect it.

Drivers never press a doorbell, sign packages without our consent, and throw them at the door. Calling customer service is an experience in patience, which by the time they get on the line is gone.

There are better ways to ship your packages with speed and confidence at a lower cost (UPS, USPS Priority Mail). Don't support them. They will only change when they feel the pain of loosing customers and volume.

I had been since then non stop calling them and their customer service company trying to get hold of my package which they say oh sorry its returned back to our facility by the driver (why? Dont ask as they dont know and i dont either)
The worst part is they refuse to change the status online from delivered to not delivered so atleast i can file a refund claim.
Which i did but since the bank asked for tracking info and as per that it shows delivered my claim was declined. I have no clue where my package is.

Right now i am typing this review while on hold at one of the zillion calls with fed ex customer service agents. Who clearly confirms my package was not delivered as they see in ""THEIR SYSTEM""but refuses to change the status online so i can see the same. To me it was showing ""delivered"" which now doesnt even show that. It just shows error. But they clearly refuse to update that info.

I am unable to confirm or prove to the shipper or the bank that my package was lost and was not delivered and that the carrier FED EX refuse to change the information to the correct one online!

I immediately took pictures, called Fedex claims and filed a report, found the fedex location in Exton PA on Creamery Lane, from where the driver came, called them and filed a report, called the local police and filed a report of property damage with the officer who came out and also took pictures.

I was subsequently put in touch with their Insurance company ARC where I provided all the information they requested, along with what it would cost to replace the mailbox, pole and installation, that I had available to substantiate my claim.

After weeks of back and forth, being told that without a video of the incident, it would be the drivers word against mine (the driver of course denied everything) they agreed to pay half/50% of the cost to replace my mailbox.

Despite I am sure thousands of similar incidents, they FedEX and their ARC Insurance Company take the word of a criminally negligent driver causing property damage AND leaving the scene of a crime!

Based on prior experiences where driver simply drops off item and drives off or they often fail to let customer know there is a delivery, we instucted merchant at all costs NOT to require signature as no one available daytime. Merchant confirmed that. Well, got a tracking email said ""attempted delivery"" but no one available. On the call to customer serice, was told that's because there MUST be a signature or nothing could be done. They suggested a work-around, eventually, in an extended frustrating call: just ""sign the delivery ticket"" to say just drop off, - but no ticket was left. When we asked to talk to a supervisor, about his unsatisfactory answers agent ""James"" put on hold and then switched to a customer survey and then they hung up.

He called and patched me through for which I still went through the gamut of choices and on hold to actually get a human being.
After struggling through the language barrier she started an investigation that ended with FEDEX would hold it at the distribution center where I could drive 80 pus miles round trip and approximately three hours in traffic to pick it up.
Then after another online search found away to have it delivered to a local FEDEX store.
They would contact when it arrived-it didn't! What a surprise!
As of late (three weeks now and hours research) nothing but an e-mail claiming it was delivered.
So apparently I'm out $108.00 and a rare antique steam engine.
FEDEX won't honor their failure. Not even close.

194,ReviewRow-533,FedEx is the absolute worst,"First of all, this is in reference to the FedEx at 458 E. Lambert in Fullerton but they aren't listed. FedEx is the absolute worst. Here are just my 3 most recent dealings with FedEx:

1. Shipping a package for the law office I work for by priority overnight on Saturday, to arrive by Monday at noon. Crucial that it arrived on time but we couldn't ship it any earlier. Was guaranteed delivery by the FedEx person who took the package, ""no problem"". It arrived on Tuesday afternoon. Tried to get through to FedEx to find out what happened and get reimbursed for the extra money spent on priority overnight delivery and got disconnected after a 30-minute wait by the person who answered the phone as soon as I started talking.

2. Receiving a delivery. They changed the delivery the day of the delivery to the next day, but no one was going to home in the morning so I called and was told ""no problem"", will be delivered after 1:00. It was delivered at 9:00 a.m. A $400 package and they left it in front of my apartment in a bad neighborhood. No signature was required by the shipper, they said. My husband had to walk out of his doctor's appointment to go home and get it. Thank God it was a big, heavy package.

3. Receiving a delivery to my business address (clearly noted as a business address on my order) so my package won't get left at my apartment door to be stolen (per no. 2 above). They tried to deliver on Sunday morning at 8:06. Then I received a message that it would be delivered the next business day. It wasn't delivered because they tried to deliver at 7:30 a.m. Called Fedex but was told there was nothing they could do, they have no way to contact their own drivers or warehouses. Called the shipper and they said they couldn't do anything, either. Then received another message from Fedex that it would be delivered Thursday at 7:45 in the morning. Called Fedex again and tried to get them to call their warehouse or drive to let them know to deliver it after 9:00 a.m. because they are delivering to a business. They again said they had no way to contact their own warehouse or their own drivers. Called again Thursday morning and, of course, they tried to deliver at 7:45 a.m. Called AGAIN. My problem was escalated and while I was on the line with the person who said he had just informed the Fedex Escalation Dept. that the delivery address was a BUSINESS and NOT a residence, the escalation person left me a message that they would try to redeliver by 8:00 p.m. And so they did. Sometime between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. Four attempts and every driver was too stupid, lazy or conniving to notice or note down that this is a business address and the escalation person was too stupid to pay attention to the very reason for the escalation! Amazing! And the punchline? They tried again to deliver over the weekend and mailed me a postcard saying that they couldn't deliver because (and I quote): ""Office closed due to COVID"". So I finally gave up, told them to send the package back to the shipper, found the same item on Amazon and ordered it there. Amazon doesn't treat their workers right but at least they can tell the difference between a residence and a business, (and it doesn't take them five times to figure it out, either).

But that's Fedex. They make promises they can't keep, they are almost impossible to get on the phone due their phone maze that hangs up on you and are full of excuses or just disconnect you when you complain about their terrible service. They can't reschedule a delivery for when someone is there but they can change delivery times and dates to suit themselves. They also have no way to email them from the U.S. but they have an email for other countries. I don't know if they are really that incompetent or they just really do not care at all about their customers. Go with UPS or USPS, ANYONE but Fedex, at least you'll save time and money and might even get your package.","August 18th, 2020",2,9,Christie B.,1.0,2021-05-30 09:53:06.575998,2021-05-30 09:53:08.791649,FedEx,Sitejabber

196,ReviewRow-589,Haven't received a single package from FedEx,"I recently moved to Texas and I have never successfully received any mail from FedEx (out of 3 packages). Only one did I have a tracking number for, and it says delivered when I did not receive anything. I've called to open an investigation and opened a claim, both of which were not followed up. I'm not sure why, but it seems all the recent reviews are negative, while I didn't have any issues from FedEx several years ago, but right now, I have 0 trust in them.

A coworker also said, ""I just watched a FedEx delivery guy pull up to our driveway, take about three steps, then chuck the package into the gravel at the side of the driveway. No where even CLOSE to the front porch. The box was torn up,"" which is what finally lead me to post this negative review.

Edit: I have finally found my 3 packages. The fault actually lies with my apartment system as I'm supposed to get an email when something arrives in the package lockers (having entered my email incorrectly), but packages were delivered as expected at least.

199,ReviewRow-272,Poor service and unresponsive management,"I have been a loyal FedEx customer for many years. I recently needed to change the address on my FedEx account from my no-longer-valid U.S. address to an Israeli one and to register for tracking updates for a particular shipment that is on its way to me. I called FedEx and an operator named Mary put me through to its International department. After a long wait I reached an agent named Charlie, who spoke with a very heavy Spanish accent, which made it quite difficult for me to understand him. Charlie kept me waiting on the line for almost half an hour. When he finally came back he told me to call their billing department. It turned out he meant the Revenue Services department. When I called the Revenue Services department I reached a lady named Becky who kept me waiting for a very long time and finally said she had updated my address but could not update my payment information, even though it was complete and accurate. She said she could not send me a screen shot of any error message either. This left me without being able to use my account to order pickups and pay for shipments. Becky then put me through to their technical support department, where an agent named Tim took my call, but the lines were crossed, my call got tangled up with their automatic telephone survey from the previous call, and Tim vanished from the line. All I heard after that was recorded messages. I called the FedEx Technical Support Department once more and get switched by an agent named Brandon to another named Anthony who registered me for the updates of my shipment. I then e-mailed John Ackerson, an executive support specialist at the company's Executive Services who had dealt with my FedEx issues before, about this. The only reply was an automatic one asking me to call a telephone number where he cannot be reached, only his voice mail. I then wrote Fred Smith, the CEO. All I got were automated replies that said my messages had been received and giving me case numbers. One of them even said ""We are reviewing your email to determine whether or not it contains fraudulent websites."" [sic!] During my last call to their billing department I reached a haughty agent named Christine who interrogated me aggressively about my personal information. When I asked her whether she wanted my U.S. or Israeli information, she replied, ""I am asking the questions here!""

FedEx customer service is dismal at best. They could care less about you.

If you do have a problem with your shipment... its your fault for selecting the shipping method you did.

My package arrived at my local hub, and then got shipped out of my state to be dropped off at a USPS facility where it got lost in the suffel. They could have at least dropped it at a local USPS facility. So what was supposed to be 5 ti 7 day delivery, took nearly a month to get my package.

245,ReviewRow-792,Shipping is always delayed.,"FedEx struggles such that shipment dates always change, and are never on time. The expected or promised delivery dates are always pushed back to a later date. My last shipment was pushed back 3 times. Deliveries never show up at the specified time in their tracking. Nothing is ever on time. One shipment was even delivered to the wrong address once, even when the address was correct on the parcel. Not a fan of FedEx. This recent shipment was scheduled to show up on May 14th (today) but now it is delayed until May 15th. It might now even show up until the 18th given the patterns I have seen. It isn't worth the bother to trust tracking. They try, I grant them that, but I am not a fan. I prefer UPS.

After waiting 6 mins without anybody coming to ask ""who's next"" he helped himself to the box and packed up his items.

268,ReviewRow-753,Worst shipping experience ever FedEd/2Go Philippines,"The worst and most incompetent shipping service I ever have experienced was with 2Go, the retail shipping partner of Federal Express in the Philippines. The conclusion must be that Federal Express service to the Philippines and within the Philippines must be considered unreliable.
A document requiring urgent delivery to Manila was sent from a Federal Express outlet in Cebu, the Philippines, on March 31. The waybill shows that it was designated for AIR shipment. Instead, 2Go sat on it for a week and then put it on a boat to Manila on April 6. It is now morningon April 8 and the package still has not arrived at its destination.
This was a crucial document, and the failure of FedEx/2Go will cost me over one thousand dollars, distress, disrupted sleep, and anxiety over the domino effect triggered by this abject negligence. One failure does not make a case, but I will not trust FedEx to, from or within the Philippines until it finds a partnership that can provide satisfactory service.
I note that 2Go fashions its expertise as ""supply chain."" I am reminded of the saying, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link – and to my regret, I found it.
I thought I might be almost alone in my criticism of FedEx. I find that even Amazon banned its vendors from shipping through Federal Express because of its poor delivery service.

The only information FedEx gave me about the whereabouts of my luggage is that they don't know where it is, that it's lost, and cannot do anything about it. Besides, FedEx made me feel foolish for using their service to ship luggage instead of a box since they are just capable of shipping boxes. So, why did you accept my luggage to be shipped in the first place?
Furthermore, FedEx declared items to German customs I don't possess. After submitting an objection form to the German customs, they explained that I have nothing to with this issue since I didn't fill out the customs form, it was FedEx who did it, and they are accountable for it. I tried to resolve the issue with FedEx since I don't want to pay customs for items I don't possess. All I got in response was a letter from the collection agency demanding to pay double of what the original bill was.
Overall, I had a very BAD experience with FedEx. Until this day, I'm still waiting to hear about my missing luggage, and know I have to pay for items I don't possess. I will NEVER use FedEx again.

THE DRIVER HELPED HERSELF TO SOME DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE COVERED CARAMEL ROLO CANDIES THEN REBOXED THEM IN A SMALL BROWN BOX WITH THE WORDS ""BONUS"" WRITTEN IN GREEN MARKER. SHE GOT AWAY WITH IT.
ON YESTERDAY FOR SOME LAZY REASON THE DRIVER DECIDED THAT HE/SHE WOULD NOT DELIVER MY PACKAGE AND THAT I WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT. ON TODAY IM EXPECTING ANOTHER PACKAGE ALONG WITH THE ONE FROM YESTERDAY. I'M ANGRILY AWAITING 2 PACKAGES ON TODAY.
A MONTH AGO A PACKAGE WHICH CONTAINED A WOMAN'S BIKE PURCHASED ON WALMART.COM WEBSITE WAS STOLEN FROM ME VIA FED EX DRIVER.
THOSE THIEVES WANT TO BE SO SMART. THE DRIVER LITERALLY USED MY LABEL TRACKING AND PLACED IT ONTO A BEAT UP BOX CONTAINING A LUGGAGE RACK AND DELIVERED THAT TO MY HOME WHILE THEY KEPT THE BIKE.
I WENT THROUGH HELL AND HIGH WATER REPORTING THIS ISSUE TO WALMART BECAUSE NEW ORLEANS FED EX SUPERVISORS ARE MORE ROUGHISH THAN THE EMPLOYEES THEY HIRE.

280,ReviewRow-531,Do not ship with Fedex!,"Do not ship with Fedex! Their package insurance is a scam first of all. I will never trust fedex to ship any package. I will only use UPS & USPS from now on. My mom shipped a package and I made sure to be home for the scheduled delivery day. When I received the text message that the package was delivered I was confused because both my husband and I did not hear a knock at the door. As soon as I saw the text message from FEDEX said delivered I opened the door and there was nothing. I am not sure if the driver just delivered it to the wrong address or what so I called and had to file a claim that my package was not delivered. I filed a claim over the phone and online with all documents and item descriptions to be thorough. It was not until a week after, when claims are supposed to be resolved within 5-7 days that I was told that my mom had to file the claim as she was the shipper. So she reached out and spoke to them and they were looking into it. Another week goes by and nothing, so she calls again, is on hold for a very long time and finally gets a supervisor who says the claim is denied. I do not have proof by a photo of the package in front of my door with my apt. # with a time stamp so no I do not believe this should be denied. It is not my responsibility to make sure the driver delivers it to the correct address/door. They denied it because they don't want to pay for the drivers error. I had over $200 worth of items in the package, it was insured for $200 and my mom payed a little less than $20 to ship it. So now because we trusted them they are saying we are screwed out of over $200 AND the cost to ship the package. This is an absolute joke and it has been a nightmare getting anyone on the phone. I have now been transferred to the incorrect person 3 times. I am not sure why it is so hard to speak to a supervisor. I guess because they are just trying to avoid actually taking responsibility for their employee and they want to save some money. So ridiculous.

281,ReviewRow-513,Avoid Them!,"I am not pursuing a vendetta. Everything here is based on experience that long predates COVID-19. In my experience FedEx loses packages, delivers them late, delivers them to the wrong address, delivers them damaged, leaves them out in the rain, leaves them where they can easily be stolen, and pays no attention to delivery instructions.

They have no customer service. They ignore complaints. They have a bewildering number of different ""services"". The recipient has no control over what ""service"" the sender used and therefore whatever the request or complaint the answer (if you can get an answer) is always 'no' because that ""service"" does not provide the feature you want, or guarantee the timeliness you need, or because the person on the other end has no idea what you're talking about and after three tries at explaining it you've run out of patience.

FedEx is just like a crooked insurance company that doesn't pay claims. They're glad to take the money but they've never heard of you after that. FedEx personnel are rude, insulting, or passive aggressive on the telephone and don't answer emails. Often the company you are buying from has a contract with FedEx that precludes any input from you the recipient. You can't have anything.

FedEx's tracking system is part of the problem. It often provides delayed and inaccurate information. I have actually been told to ignore it and be patient. Well patience is a virtue but if the tracking system isn't helpful why have it at all? Simply wait for your package to arrive late and damaged. Tracking it just adds to the annoyance.

I once had a FedEx delivery person throw five heavy boxes out of the front of his truck onto the street and then without using a handcart drag them nearer the house leaving them out in the rain piled up on the sidewalk and blocking the front gate open with none of the boxes on or near the front porch where they belonged. He drove off swearing at me. Some of the contents were shattered due to the rough handling. I had to open the boxes in the rain and carry the contents up the front steps because the full boxes were too heavy to lift. FedEx took the complaint but never followed up on it and had the gall to say that they wouldn't before hanging up on me.

I ordered some pies. FedEx delivered them upside down ignoring the markings on the box. One of the pies was mostly disintegrated from the rough handling. When frozen food packed in dry ice defrosts, as it will when an extra day or two is incompetently added to the transit time, it is much more fragile. Bouncing it around causes the containers to break and the contents to spill into the box. Again, I am speaking from experience. Do not buy perishable food from a company that ships via FedEx. You'll be sorry.

Since writing the above, FedEx has made two deliveries to nearby addresses up and down the street. The packages were properly addressed to this residence, which has been here for over a hundred years with the street number prominently displayed. Someone can't read or can't think. Packages are arriving with the cardboard broken open in several places. It has been retaped but why smash boxes around until they break open? Their tracking system claims never to have received a package that has been physically picked up by them according to the shipper. One returned package never arrived. Another went to the wrong city and some of the contents were apparently stolen. It's endless.

I have stopped doing business with Veestro (a good company and probably the only one in the USA that prepares frozen vegan meals) because FedEx kept delaying the deliveries so that I received a defrosted mess. They once took two additional weekdays to deliver the package after it reached their depot fifteen miles away! I will probably have to stop doing business with Chewy, another good company, because FedEx can't deliver their large boxes intact. I have tried to explain to the customer service reps that they are risking their company's reputation by using FedEx exclusively, so far to no avail. It seems that Amazon stopped doing business with FedEx at least partially because of FedEx's poor performance. More large companies need to follow suit.

FedEx does have decent delivery drivers who do their best once they arrive at your place but they can't really compensate for the damage and delay caused by their co-workers on FedEx's weirdly convoluted delivery routes. When you buy something see if it can be shipped via USPS, UPS, DHL, OnTrac--anybody but FedEx. You might have to pay more but you'll save time and money in the long run. Or order from Amazon, which does its own delivery, rather well too.

They tell you that it will be delivered today by end of day, then by end of day you check in with the company to make sure that it's actually coming, so you don't stay up until 9pm waiting and then right as you get so tired you have to go to bed they update their app and tell you it will be three more days, they go back and change all your estimated delivery times to the next day. They then continue this process for days and days.

I immediately called FedEx to let them know that I did not receive the package. They kept telling me it was delivered and I should go asked my neighbors. I had just gotten home when the package was supposedly delivered. They eventually said that info will be sent to the warehouse and investigate with the driver to find out what happened. After calling 4 days in a row, I was finally transferred to the warehouse where the manager told me nothing was sent over to the warehouse and they didnt know about a missing package. She also proceeded to say the driver has been doing that route for years and he didnt take the tablet. I told her that I didnt get it either. The driver did no deliver anything at my house. I was told the driver will not be in until a few days. It took almost a week to speak to the driver, who said he did not remember anything about the delivery. They gave me a run around after that. I had to get a police report and had the manufacturer file a claim. I have NEVER experienced this before. I'm not sure what's going on with FEDEX, but this I find to be very suspicious.

I was supposed to be getting a freezer delivered between Monday and Wednesday of this week. Tuesday it was supposed to be on the truck it was but then there was a delivery exception. Whatever that means. Wednesday morning it's out on the truck I am waiting all day. At 6:40 I call them they tell me it'll be there by 9 I said okay I said what is the delivery exception he says it was too big for our truck we had to put it on a different Truck. It was a 5 cubic foot freezer I didn't think it was that big but whatever. Now 9:32 I call them because it was not delivered by 9. The second guy, rysheed over in bumfuk India turn around and told me that they weren't able to deliver it because they didn't have my proper address that my apartment number wasn't on it. I said really I've gotten four deliveries from Walmart this week alone and all of them came to my door with the apartment number. While I'm talking to this guy who by the way says that the delivery exception from the day before was not because it was the wrong size but because they had the wrong address and they contacted Walmart. While I'm talking to him my driver is delivering my freezer to the wrong f%@king address or the wrong apartment number. I live in a huge development I don't know who signed for this but it wasn't me and it wasn't my neighbors it was somebody in another building. They suck monkey balls!
I had to call Walmart and complain they said that they would gladly refund my money because the store was out of freezers and they couldn't send me a new one so now I have to wait for them to get more in stock. I told the guy at Walmart to make a notation on my account that, number one, when they do get more I better not pay more than I did this time, and, number two, they better use a different f%@king carrier besides FedEx because FedEx sucks balls. An interesting side note when I was on the phone the first time with this guy he took my phone number and said he would give me a call when they're ready to deliver because I complain to him that FedEx drops the $#*! at my door and runs. I said number one there's porch Pirates number two I'm an older woman who's physically disabled and cannot lift a 69 pound freezer and bring it in the house I need him to at least bring it in and put it close to where I want it and I will figure out the rest with my neighbor he said ""he will call you When we're delivering it, it's funny I didn't get a phone call when they were Misdelivering it.","April 14th, 2021",2,1,Elaina D.,1.0,2021-05-30 09:59:43.734432,2021-05-30 09:59:45.978433,FedEx,Sitejabber

I then use fedex's nifty proof of delivery link which Shows a picture of the signature for the package and when I checked it was just a line. I call fedex the next day and give my information and my phone number so they can call me when the delivery person is near and I can come out of the building and grab it. The next day comes around and no delivery from fedex once again so I call and they tell me my local depot (which THEY called ME saying it has my package) hasn't even acknowledged they have my package (?) But I should get it soon. Next day rolls around (Thursday when expected delivery Monday) and I call again and this time the fedex service rep informs me they actually delivered it to the wrong person on Monday and have re-acquired it and I will receive it tomorrow now. At this point I am getting upset since I've been told for the last 3 days that they tried their little hearts out to deliver it but they couldn't because it was closed BUT they still had my package.

329,ReviewRow-574,Far too many bad experiences in my attempts receiving FedEx packages,"Packages left by the front door of our security building, when all the driver has to do is call in on the call box to be buzzed in to the lobby; where they usually leave all of the packages in a big pile instead of bringing them to the unit. I had a package coming that I was at home waiting for, and they left unable to deliver notes on the front door 3 days in a row while I was by the phone waiting for them to call. I would have buzzed them in if they had just used the call box. Beyond absurd. Frequently packages for our building are left across the street at another Condo building, and we get some of theirs. These too are left by the front door quite frequently. Just use aUSPS or UPS, the latter are vastly improved over what they were.

330,ReviewRow-238,Don't use FedEx if you have any other option,"I sent a $2,000 package to Mexico via FedEx in August. They charged me $500 to send it. The recipient did not accept the package and basically said ""return to sender"". But they didn't return it. I never saw it again.

The customer service while trying to have my package returned was horrible. I called once a week every week starting in August. Every single week I talked to a different person, never the same person twice after the first few weeks. Every time I called, the new person was unfamiliar with my case would have to put me on hold while they read the notes of the case, which got longer and more confusing every week to the point that I got completely different information every week. I was told that the package was on it's way back to me. Then I was told that it was delivered to the wrong address while trying to return it and they couldn't get it back so I would have to file a claim. I filed a claim, and a few weeks later they walked back what they said about delivering it to the wrong address and instead started blaming it on Mexican customs. They said that Mexican customs had designated it ""abandoned"" because I waited so long to ask for it to be returned (but I had asked for it's return IMMEDIATELY. The long wait was the slow FedEX customer service time. The delay was their fault, not mine). They said they were not liable for it if it was Mexican customs fault. Which was convenient since I was told it was delivered to the wrong address until I filed the claim, and then suddenly it was Mexican customs who marked it ""abandoned"" and took possession of it. One time somebody told me they couldn't make sense of the long and confusing notes to the case since so many people had worked on it and they would have to have someone call me back. No one ever called. The next week they said the same thing and I said ""They said that last week but nobody ever called me back"" They said impatiently ""I PROMISE somebody will call you back"". Nobody ever called me back. A few weeks later, I was promised a call back, and I mentioned this. This person said ""This time someone will call you back. I promise you, sir"". No one ever called back.

I sent the package in August. The second it was marked ""return to sender"" I got to work trying to get it back. That included opening two cases in August. Then filing a claim in November because it was supposedly sent to the wrong address. Then filing another claim in December because the first claim somehow got ""accidentally"" closed. Then filing a THIRD claim in December because the second claim got closed and nobody could figure out why. Finally, in January, over four months after I sent the package, I received a phone call that said my claim was denied.

I basically paid them $500 to lose my very expensive package. It was never delivered or returned. It was just $2500 down the drain. That's a drop in the bucket to a multi-billion dollar international corporation like FedEX. But to me that kind of money really, really, hurts. The job they did and the customer service afterwards was absolutely shameful. If you have ANY other option when shipping something I strongly recommend you take it, even if it costs a little more. It will be a lot safer for you.","January 3rd, 2020",1,1,Quint O.,1.0,2021-05-30 10:00:46.931586,2021-05-30 10:00:51.147607,FedEx,Sitejabber
331,ReviewRow-594,Very unfortunate,"If I could give it zero stars I would! We had a delivery expected on a Friday that had to be signed for. My husband took the day off to be home. When they arrived my husband wasn't able to answer the door at that exact moment (I know, our fault!). He did leave a note on the door asking them to still leave it (he was inside after all, just in the shower). I get it, they can't - ok, still our fault. Of course, the delivery shows up the second he gets into the shower and they do not leave the package. We are told to pick it up after 7pm that evening. Okay, got it. However the building also closes at 7. I call the office to speak with someone about what my options are. I'm told: 1. Your husband must be the one to pick it up - I'm not sure why as everything has been in my name. Which is also extremely inconvenient as he's out of town now (later that evening) but again, something that clearly had to do on our end. 2. You can call back around 6ish to see if the delivery has made it back to the building. I live 40 minutes away - will I be able to make it (two kids in tow)? But yet again I'm reminded, it doesn't matter because they won't allow me to even sign for it. 3. Come back tomorrow from 10-4. We work. We already took a day off to be here for it.? 4. We will deliver it the next business day. Okay; so we are back to Monday. And we work. Again. We won't be able to be home to sign. Plus they are closed on Sunday when we would actually be able to pick it up. 5. Put a hold on it and come pick it up Monday evening. Okay, yes let's do that. However- it STILL has to be your husband to pick it up and sign for it. Not you. He has community obligations with boards that he is on and has meetings that night. How about Tuesday? You get my frustration. But what really put me over the top, was the rudeness and unprofessional way I was spoken to by their employee. I was appalled. I get the circumstances were not their fault and somethings are out of their control but there was no offer the help the situation or see what they could do.

332,ReviewRow-249,How is this legal?,"Shocked and disgusted. I shipped a package in from America using MyUS's services. MyUS made the mistake of listing the value of the package as more than double its actual value ($924.99 instead of $419.98) even though I submitted the invoice from Amazon before the package was even logged. I notified them immediately of the problem before the package was even marked for shipping. Eventually they rectified their mistake and paid me the erroneous overcharged amount for insurance and insured me that they will notify FedEx of the problem so that they don't charge me incorrectly for import taxes.

Shortly afterwards I had a phone call with a FedEx employee (Innocentia Sithebe) and notified her on the call about the error and afterwards I sent her an email with the original invoice as proof of the actual value of the package. (This was before the package even left America). I have the emails as proof.

A week later I got an invoice from FedEx to pay more than double the VAT that I should be paying and listed the incorrect value of the package $924.99 (Instead of $419.98). I responded immediately notifying them that they made a mistake and forwarded them the email correspondence that I had with both MyUS and FedEx to notify them of the problem far in advance, but FedEx (Vanessa Christine Vorster) told me that customs cannot accept a second entry and FedEx will not be taking responsibility for the mistake even though I forwarded them all the proof that I did everything in my power to notify them far in advance.

I am honestly lost for words. I did everything in my power to try and fix other people's mistakes as soon as possible, but still they just bulldoze over you and refuse to take responsibility for their mistakes.

337,ReviewRow-644,Can not Trust them,I am extremely disappointed with the service i continue to receive. When i call fed ex about packages in the past i have been told things that was not upheld to. I run a company and i have to always tell my clients that they will not have their product for the event due to fed ex not doing what they said they were going to do. I have also had inventory ruined due to this as well. This time my date was changed once again without anyone calling or sending a notification to my phone. By the time i got a chance to check the tracking and called i was told that i couldnt even come to pick it up. Due to it being at a ware house. I have an event today and i was told that i would get a phone call with someone telling me weather or not they would be able to get it here by 1030 which is the latest i can have it delivered so that my client can have it in time. Instead i got a very aggravating phone call by someone who was just repeating the information that was already on file with no answer to my question or solution to my situation. It is now the 19th at 10:50 am and my package still is not here and i did not get any phone call. This company has let me down as a customer over and over. And these issues have nothing to due with the holiday or covid. I say this because these issues were happening before all of this.

338,ReviewRow-560,Don't use Fedex if you have the choice,"Absolutely disgusted with my experience. Before I get into it-- I don't have a problem with Fedex delivery people or branch offices. It's upper management and inflexible company policy that makes things ridiculously difficult for everyone else.
I had a product delivered from CA to VA. It is a week and a half past the projected delivery date (hasn't arrived yet), which during a pandemic, is understandable. Tracking wasn't updated for a week. Still understandable. HOWEVER, delivery today failed because they 'didn't have my apartment number.' I had called management days prior to give them my apartment number. Today, when I realized that delivery had failed, I called customer service to attempt to give them my apartment number. They wouldn't take the information because apparently only the shipper can provide that information/there were restrictions on the delivery placed by the shipper. It's just an apartment unit number and FedEx already had my address and phone number but OKaY. So I called the shipper and they called FedEx. Despite what FedEx had said before about only letting the shipper add address info, they also would not let the guy from the company tell them my unit number, apparently because he 'didn't have a premier code.' The dude works for the company that shipped my item, and this information is my $#*!ing apartment unit, not even the address (which FedEx already has!), WHY CAN'T FEDEX JUST TAKE THE DAMN INFO AND MAKE DELIVERY EASIER ON EVERYONE.

Advice: When you, a customer, calls customer service, expect that you will be speaking to outsourced employees. They're professional and friendly, but seem unable to provide anything beyond basic info on your shipment/FedEx in general, and don't seem to have the freedom to make judgement calls that will make delivery more efficient (even if you give them a solution + all the information needed for delivery). My recommended solution is to find and call the number of the branch office where your product has been delivered (if you have that information). Branch managers have more autonomy, and can actually check/edit info/send out your package, and you're much better off contacting them directly, rather than trying to go through the $#*!ty customer service system. Hope this helps someone. Also just don't use FedEx if you can help it. $#*! FedEx.","September 5th, 2020",1,0,Z C.,1.0,2021-05-30 10:01:12.083551,2021-05-30 10:01:15.344614,FedEx,Sitejabber
339,ReviewRow-660,Didn't Even Try To Deliver,"Hi. I ordered phone, paid for next day delivery. Fedex left a note, I signed note same day and taped to the door (it's still on the door actually). Tracking number shows they never came back. We called and asked where to pick it up, they said we can't, it can only be shipped. A few days later we tried to call again, but they no longer had a person to speak to, just an automated voice saying there's no one to talk to. When I tried to sign up to Fedex online to manage package and see if that could help, it required a phone, the one sitting in their facility that I ordered but they failed to deliver, so obviously I couldn't use a phone to sign up. 12 days later they sent my package back to shipper. We recommended the shipper switch package delivery companies, since UPS and USPS didn't give us any problems like these. Shipper is considering it, due to our request, and because Fedex has given them recurring problems. I have reordered phone, without next day delivery this time. I will now be watching tracking number for delivery day, then sitting at window all that day waiting for Fedex to arrive to ensure I don't miss my package. This stuff shouldn't happen. They should have allowed us to pick up our package, so they wouldn't have a bad review, so they wouldn't have had to worry about delivery, so they wouldn't have had to put all that work into shipping it back to sender when they failed to make a delivery attempt after note was left. It makes no sense to have no pickup location. Did the guy we talk to not even know what he is doing? Or is this seriously a Fedex policy?

They gave me zero indication that I could be refunded the $19. When I sent a message through a form on the FedEx website for a complaint, I got no response. When I called the FedEx customer service phone number and selected the option for requesting a refund for late delivery, and provided my tracking number, the automated woman's voice said my refund request was denied!

The upsetting experience that I just had with Fedex is embarrasing from a company that is known all over. The drivers are careless, negligents and incompetents, they drop off packages to whatever addresses they feel like just to get empty out their hands. I had a package that dropped off by a Fedex driver at a random USPS location without a known reason, the package is lost without a track and Fedex is not responsable for anything, I have literally called Fedex 20 times without getting to a positive results. I will not ever recommend this incompetent delivery company to anyone. However I got a couple more deliveries from DHL and their service was outstanding. DHL is the responsable company you want to use for your personal or busuness use. I gave Fedex a star because I do not see the minus Zero stars which is what Fedex deserves. Now I have to call the shipper to see what we can do with this hassle.

They left it in their warehouse in another town for days, then I called and they put a trace on my package and their trace showed that it was delivered to my home days before when it never was.
I called again and they told me to take it up with the seller on ebay but it wasn't the sellers fault. It was FedEx.
So I hope the employee is enjoying my son's bed frame. Hopefully it went to another child and not some creepy dude driver that's using it or something. I hope the guy who took it is 6""3' and has no chance being comfortable in my 9 year old son's bed.
I mean, they steal people's items, customer service is not very good.
Their shirts say they care, they don't care. They only want the money and they open people's packages and all the drivers are super rude. Idk why. Maybe they're all miserable in that joke of a shipping company?
Idk why this service is so horrible. They don't give you respect and they lose items and they lie and they get away with it.
I wonder if the head honchos of this company know about how terrible their employees are. They should have them be on camera at their jobs to stop. Employees from stealing and really come down hard on their people working in the customer service and listen to the customers because we tell how it is and how it goes.
I mean most people hate fedex... It's no wonder.
Who is the CEO of this company? Is he sleeping? On vacation? Sitting back with a cigar and an iced tea? Maybe he's in a coma and that is why this company went to sh**?

Then we went to the FedEx location at 2413 Flatbush 5:45 pm, they said they are not sure what is going on. So, they put us on the line with number *******747. They said the package is with US Customs and might receive the package on Tuesday.

After 15 min later at 6:11pm FedEx called me and said the package is lost and emailed me the form to fill out and file complaint. Phone call received at 6:11 pm spoke about 26 min. This is the number +1 *******339 ""package could be lost or shedder"". She had also mentioned thin mail like checks and one page mailing sometimes get shredded in the conveyor belt if not in the appropriate conveyor belt. I have stated this was a car title, particularly important paperwork, and have paid accordingly.
The customer service rep also mentioned that FedEx employees routinely lie about the status of packages, sometimes knowingly knowing the package is lost and telling customers that they are not lost and are on track to be delivered.
My brother, who works for the US Government, a Patriot, working to keep terrorists at bay and protect American citizens, was not able to get a simple, business as usual package to be delivered by FedEx, a car title that he needed to register with the government of Canada on behalf of the USA.

EVERY package I receive from FedEx is delivered left on my grass (even when it's raining) because they don't want to take 4 more steps and step up on my porch. Two shipments ago, the delivery driver actually tossed the heavy boxes of kitty litter onto the wet grass and left them not even sitting straight. This entire shipment was 4 boxes that couldn't even stack because the box underneath was sitting cockeyed.

I have arthritis and a bad back and have had to move boxes with canned cat food, three cat condos, and kitty litter up the step onto my porch myself. It's even more fun when the boxes are wet and fall apart which is what happened last time. My porch is 5'x5'. There is plenty of room for them to leave multiple boxes.

I reported them to Chewy who is the vendor that uses FedEx and complained. I have been informed that FedEx is out of contract by not delivering to the door so they will be ""coached"", whatever that means. Apparently, with the COVID situation, these guys have immunity and can perform as poorly as they want and cannot be fired. You can tell by their job performance.

I called Federal Express and got a representative who was obviously reading from a script. I told her I hurt my back moving boxes up a step I shouldn't have to and she said she wrote it all down. I asked what kind of compensation I would get to insure and this would not happen again. She hemmed and hawed and said nothing. I asked if the same driver always delivers to my location. She said she is not given that information. I asked her how can I be assured that this will stop. She hemmed and hawed again and I said, ""Your script doesn't cover these questions, does it?"" She said, ""Yes, it does."" I think that said it all. She said, ""I'm sorry you hurt your back. Have a nice rest of your day."" That was very helpful, right?

392,ReviewRow-187,Worst service. Lost $300 shipment. Lost it twice. No refund,"I have had very bad experience not just once but twice with the FedEx service.

1. This is about a local ground shipment from Walmart. And the delivery guy gave the packet at wrong address but their system is updated with FedEx tracking saying that delivered at my address outside the front door. Came home that evening, couldn't find the packet outside my door and searched in my neighbourhood and with my neighbors, not there. Finally, decided to raise a complaint on FedEx website and raised a claim. Waited for their investigation and after 3 days, the delivery guy got back that missing packet to my address from a wrong address where he actually delivered wrongly ( may be he is asleep, drunk or just dumb, irresponsible). I can understand mistakes happen. But my packet was already opened by the people at the wrong address.

2. This time it was a international shipment from my home country worth $300 dollars. Believed in FedEx, that was our biggest mistake. After tracking the delivery details on their website, it says, delivered at my address outside my front door on the same day as the above case. After I couldn't find this $300 worth shipment anywhere, raised a complaint to FedEx and told them that a local ground shipment packet was also missing on the same day and may be the delivery guy gave these both at wrong address. After 3 days the local Walmart shipment was got to me from the address where it was delivered wrongly but for the $300 international shipment, FedEx sent a letter saying that package was delivered properly at the correct address and they rejected my claim.

Bottom line is when the delivery guy messed up everything as you can see that one of the local ground shipment was got back to me in next 3 days. How can now FedEx say that the other international shipment is delivered correctly. That is just disgusting.

Lost $300, time more that 1 month in entire process and faith in FedEx.

Maybe perhaps your whole company should go out of business because you simply don't care. To summary issues getting delivery from one vendor: 1. Two shipments were left at the street. See photo 2. The third shipment was delivered 1/2 way to the front porch, left in the sun, and delivered a day late. Wild Alaskan replaced it with shipment 4.3. Shipment 4 also was dropped off 1/2 way to the front porch in the sun. It was still frozen when we got it.
4. Shipment 5 shipped 7/1, and was to be delivered on 7/3. On 7/3 at 2:58pm local, it was logged as ""delivery attempted"" and returned to the FedEx shipping depot. It sat through 7/4. On 7/5, someone forgot to put it on the truck, so it sat in the depot. It was delivered on 7/6.

What's worse is that they drive right past my house every time to deliver it to the wrong address. They drive within 10 feet of my carport which has my house number in 4"" numbers displayed.

Immediately I contacted fedex to find out what was going on. Spoke with a customer service representative who verified my address and told me my address was correct on the package.

433,ReviewRow-173,I suggest never to use Fedex services,"Hi,

I suggest never to use Fedex services or give anyone your Fedex account number to make a shipment to you.

They abuse the fact that the account holder is not making the shipment and can not approve cost.

Here is what happened.

My customer wanted to us to ship a personal item to him and gave us his Fedex account #.

The goods to be shipped are 2 tee shirts and 2 shorts. It is almost 5 pounds but by the rule of package sizes it is regarded 20 pounds.as We shipped from Istanbul to New York with the Fedex account # of the customer.

Now hear this.

My customer gets an invoice of $2064. 29 for this shipment and as you can expect is crazy with our operaration.

FYI, the cost of two way airline ticket to Istanbul NY is $600.

My factory in Istanbul checked what if they sent this package with their own account instead of using customer Fedex acc #.

It turns out we would have paid $125.

Can you see the game Fedex is playing, and this is not the first time.

Taled to customer service couple of times, and they provided a $900 discount. But then I find out they charged is with wrong package size. So they charged my customer 4 time the volume.

I am now trying to prove that the size was entered wrong in their systems.

Bottom line.

Don't give anyone your Fedex account #. Fedex will abuse it. You will get the surprise later so all is happened already. No accapence of price before shipment. Fedex claims that they can not give cost of shipment to anyone else but other then the account holder. They do not request approval from the account holder the cost. So they ship and bat it will be paid.

I am refunding the whole cost to my customer on what he paid to Fedex and that is how customers needs to be treated.

436,ReviewRow-203,SO fed up with FedEx,"There have been so many issues this month. First, I ordered my school books for my last semester of college. I couldn't order them until 08/11/19 due to financial aid. I needed them by 08/21/19, and even paid extra for faster shipping to get them by 08/16/19. When I tracked the package, the books still weren't even going to arrive until 08/21/19. On 08/21/19, it showed that the package had been delivered but I had no package. FedEx delivered to the wrong house. So, I called customer service and they told me that the driver has three business days to conduct an investigation, and after that I can file a claim. I explained that I didn't have that long because my semester started today, and I don't have the books. They said there was nothing they could do. After three business days, I called them back and they told me that the investigation showed that the books were delivered to the wrong house, and now I could file a claim and it would be escalated within three business days and in the meantime I could just reorder the text books. I explained that the text books were almost $400.00, and I didn't have the money to order them again. Luckily, the house that they were delivered to dropped them off at my local post office, and my mailman brought them to me the next day.

That same week, I was expecting a subscription box that was supposed to arrive on 08/22/19. My box was rerouted three times, adding an extra week to the delivery time. I didn't receive it until the 29th. When I called customer service, they had no explanation as to why it kept going back and forth between the same two states for almost a week.

THEN, less than a week later, I ordered a new laptop from Walmart with overnight delivery. I didn't receive it the next day, or the day after that. On the third day, it finally said delivered, and again... delivered to the wrong house. So, I had to call customer service again, and they gave me the same time frames as they did the first time. I did receive it on the fourth day, the day AFTER the tracking said it was delivered to my front door.

We had signaled properly, and had enough room, and the FedEx driver was blatently laughing at our car, as well as flashing us the middle finger for about a mile after the incident. The vehicle number 87729 was and the plate number was 32300W. We immediately called FedEx to complain about this unsafe delivery driver in their fleet, and customer service said that they would ""look into it"" and would call me back within two days. This happened over 4 weeks ago now, and we never got a call back. I have video of the driver laughing and brushing it off like it was nothing - of course he stopped flashing the middle finger as soon as he saw I flipped out my phone to record his sorry driving actions as I'm sure he wants to claim he was 'innocent' of all actions like lairs always do! At this point, I am demanding that driver be FIRED. Not 'warned', not 'disciplined', not 'written up', but FIRED because we never got an apology from EITHER FedEx or that lame delivery fool.

I went in to the local FedEx in my neighborhood (626 E Michigan Ave, East Lansing, MI 48823). I tried to print my document and it did not print as there was no paper, but I was charged. When i requested the staff to look at it she was rude to begin with. Next she put in some papers in the printer and I tried again and it did not work again, but I was charged a second time. I went to the same lady and she was super rude and told me how I was doing everything wrong and did not even know how to print. After waiting for a lot of time, I asked her to come and help me with it. This time she came and directed me to print and my document did not print even the third time. She just went off and asked me to wait for as long as I can. After waiting for almost 5-7 minutes I realized it was not going to work out and I asked her about the printing again and she replied that she was not responsible for it without any trace of care for troubling a customer. At that time I really did not know, who to talk to and how to sort it out. So, asked for a refund, and she looked into her system and said my card had been charged only once and she would refund me for that time.

These people doesn't know how to run a courier or they don't value the importance of their customers. I'm from India, and I got frustrated with the actions from this courier company. Really frustrating to see a renowned company like FedEx doing so. I placed an order online and they shipped it through this garbage courier company. I expected the product to arrive yesterday and it was out for delivery too. I didn't receive it till 8 p.m. When I checked the tracking details, it said that ""Refused by recipient"". Immediately I called their customer support and told them that their courier guy has neither called me up nor rang the doorbell of my home. Without doing anything how can he make such statement (""Refused by recipient"") I asked. That person took the complaint and promised me that the shipment will be done by today. But when I checked the tracking status today, it shows as ""The package is being returned to the shipper"". Now I have to place another order and wait for the product to reach me after 3 days or so. May I know what the f**k are company management doing? When a courier guy says that the product is being refused by recipient, shouldn't be a double check from the superior to know whether the courier guy has said it right. This happens with most of the courier companies in India. Fraudsters are working as courier guys who loots, gives wrong details at the company when they fail to deliver, and so on.

493,ReviewRow-125,"THEFT, LIES, INCOMPETENCE, HAVOC","FedEx employees or affiliates in contact with my packages SLIT OPEN the tape on my boxes AND STOLE my property during shipment across the US.

I spent A LOT of money shipping several boxes. Not only did the staff continually screw up my online, over the phone and in person pick up with my order pretty much EVERY TIME, but they also STOLE from me and refused to acknowledge this crime even happened. All they could do was say: ""sorry your boxes got lost.""

My boxes were CUT OPEN, STOLEN FROM, taped back up and delivered from My personal location A to my second personal location B EMPTY or nearly EMPTY. How does a delivery person drop off a box that is CLEARLY labeled ""30 LBS"" and ""28LBS"" and the weight is practically nothing at delivery?

My CANCER MEDICATION and other valuable personal items were stolen.

I am continually appalled by this company and this THEFT was the LAST STRAW.

I WILL NEVER USE FEDEX AGAIN.

This was only the most recent thing that happened to me, after giving this absurd company multiple chances to redeem the quality of their service.

Last summer, they lost... LOST a 100LB Air Conditioner that was Expedited shipping for medical purposes.

Also, last fall, they delivered an exercise bike I ordered online TO ANOTHER ADDRESS, when it was CLEARLY marked with my address and needed a signature upon delivery. They left it in an empty office with no one around.

MULTIPLE TIMES, Fedex would send me text or email claiming my packages were delivered, but they were NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. OR --- they would claim ""Undeliverable"" because no one was home or ""business closed"" when they were delivering TO MY HOME and when I was sitting by the door waiting for certain products.

But they did not keep any of their promises. They actually caused damage to the items sent, and they were finally delivered in 7 working days instead of 2 that they had promised. Contacting their customer support when the delay was obvious they were saying that something happened and that the package would be delivered soon enough.

496,ReviewRow-195,Can I give minus stars? How about a minus 5 star?,"I have to say that this was the ABSOLUTE WORST shipping experience with Fedex that I have EVER HAD. EVER. And I don't want to ever have to repeat it either.

I ordered a lift kit from AutoAnything and they paid Fedex 2day shipping to get it to me. Guess what Fedex did? Made it last 7 days.

I'm currently in Fairbanks, AK. The part was being shipped out of Lansing, MI. It left the facility okay, Made it from Lexington, KY to Anchorage, AK okay. And that's where everything stopped. Fedex kept it in Anchorage for THREE DAYS. No word, no explanation. No delivery date. Nothing.

I had to contact Fedex live chat in order to find out what was going on. All in all, I had to talk to Fedex at least 3 times. They had to open 2 cases regarding this package. The funny thing is, the minute I contacted them the first time, Fedex contacted me back and explained that the package was being held for border issues. Why? It didn't cross any borders. It was flown into Anchorage from the states.

As soon, as Fedex called me, the package was mysteriously back en route again. And amazingly, it only took 2 hours to get from Anchorage to Fairbanks. How did they do it?

Then it stalled for 2 more days in Fairbanks. I had to chat with Fedex again twice. I asked them if they were planning on keeping the package indefinitely or were they going to eventually release it? The customer service rep opened another case, promised that Fedex would contact me (which they never did) and as soon as the third chat ended, the package was mysteriously scanned onto a truck for delivery within 15 minutes. How does this happen?

Needless to say, a Fedex 2day delivery turned into a Fedex 7day delivery and would not have delivered then if I hadn't BEGGED them to release my package.

And quite honestly, I was expecting my package to be destroyed when it finally delivered. I figured Fedex would have used it as a basketball or football. I was surprised to see it intact actually. Very surprised. Mystified almost.

Upon receipt of the package, I did contact AutoAnything back and suggested to them that they get their shipping charges reimbursed since the order to deliver wasn't honored. They thanked me for the information.

497,ReviewRow-132,Terrible company to use,"Total lack of customer service, constant misdeliveries or lost deliveries and a system that is so inept it should be shut down. There is absolutely nothing good to say about this so-called delivery service. I always ask everything I buy online NOT to use this company but the usual reply is to pay for a signature service (which again is useless) or this is the only shipper they use. With all the terrible reviews this company garners it's amazing it is still in business.

I am not a complainer and have 100's of reviews at Amazon and eBay with over 98% all positive but I just cannot take the poor service FedEx believes it can get away with. I have used them for over 10 years or more and back in the day they were actually a great company but the last 3 plus years they have sunken to the bottom of the barrel. I had to stop purchasing from a couple of companies I love because they will only use FedEx and I am sure it is because of the low rates they must offer. (PLEASE CHEWY.COM change your delivery service, I miss purchasing from you.)

I believe in paying more for better service and also believe you get what you pay for. So FedEx must have gotten so bad they offer extremely low rates for companies to use them as their exclusive delivery service. But this will catch up to them and the companies that continue to offer this as their only shipping option.

I would have never thought to say this but the service at our governments' postal service has been outstanding. UPS has also been easy to use as well but in my opinion not as good as USPS.

I would be embarrassed to say I work for FedEx. The whole system needs to be overhauled including getting rid of the current management who feel treating the customers as inconveniences rather than their lifeblood.","July 15th, 2018",2,3,Glenn G.,1.0,2021-05-30 10:10:27.340699,2021-05-30 10:10:30.537274,FedEx,Sitejabber

(We could see the package on our step via the security camera.) When contacted they said they had not made any deliveries to my address in 6 days. I had an email that arrived prior to my calling them that advised the delivery was made the day before I called. The agent also denied seeing any vacation hold placed on my account or for my address, although when I went on line, the hold was still in place. They also have been delivering packages with damage even worse than UPS (and that says a lot!)

Having Fedex in the name is completely misleading to the american public and someone should bring a class action lawsuit up against them because of them spending years building up the name Fedex a being a fast delivery and bait and switching you into this crap.
Here's my story: my package shipped on 08/22/2017@ 8:47 pm from Henderson CO, via Fedex SMARTPOST. Fedex says it will take until 09/02/2017 to get to it's destination in GA, 1578 miles away (that is 12 days). Which means that my package is traveling at 5.23 miles per hour. How could it possibly be that slow. Is it on a camel? Is there someone walking it to me? I don't understand what the problem is. I was never informed that my Fedex Smartpost delivery was actual this slow prior to my order I feel completely tricked into this shipping option that I never would have chosen.

In the future I will now go completely out of my way to insure that any item that I have shipped to me IS NEVER SENT BY Fedex or Fedex SMARTPOST, I will warn all of my friends and family and I will post on every social media outlet that I can find how crappy this service is.

YOUR STUFF ARRIVES BROKEN OR IS LEFT IN ANOTHER STATE.,"Fed Ex is the case story of the demise of a great idea and what was formerly a ""We Try Harder"" business as they came from behind with United Parcel Service, aka UPS. For 10 years now, Fed Ex is totally a junk business. Once FedEx eliminated employees and went to their current independent contractor Ground Service, my stuff has been left in other states, dropped on the roadway several miles from my home, stolen by who knows who and destroyed onroute. Fed Ex is so bad, if the merchant uses Fed Ex, I go else where. I will not buy goods from merchants who use Fed Ex. So, many merchants have started hiding and concealing their shipping information so you don't know that they are going to use Fed Ex. Good Grief. Even the merchants know how really bad Fed Ex is! One of the problems is that the merchant bills you, your stuff eventually gets loaded into a Fed Ex Truck, and then you never get your goods, but the merchant has your money. Good luck trying to get your money back from the merchant! The good news is that there are two other new entrants into the shipping and delivery system that are doing a great job. One is the shipper called OnTrac, although not getting the positive reviews we'd like to see! Do all you can to get merchants to switch! I was just stuck with a shipment going by Fed Ex and not only did they take my package back from the post office, they re-routed it without any reason to a strange post office with a different zip code more than 2.5 hours away from the shipping address. No one seems to be able to read English at Fed Ex, or this is another scam where Fed Ex steals your just purchased goods. That's the last straw for me.

Ok, FedEx said it would try the next day, between 10am-4pm. Again, no one came within the window. Then the driver came after we went out for dinner. So, the delivery was not successful. On Thursday, again, FedEx did not come within the 10am-4pm window as they said. To ensure that we could get the package, I told the security person of the apartment to pay special attention to FedEx delivery, and we did not use our home phone just in case FedEx might call us, FedEx customer service even promised me that they had given the driver my cell phone so that the driver could call me just in case. I thought we would be able to get the delivery this time for sure. We waited till 8pm. No one came. And, the tracking update changed, saying that the delivery failed because no one at home to sign! It was totally a lie! I called customer service. They apologized again, and suggested me to pick up from their delivery site. I agreed even though it was so annoying because I needed my stuff desperately. FedEx promised me the package would be on the site before 7pm Friday. I waited, and waited, but did not get noticing phone call from FedEx. I then called FedEx, and was told that it would take 20-48 hours to deliver to their site from the time I told them I agreed to pick it up. Thus, I would only be able to get it on Saturday. I was very mad, but had no choice. However, on Saturday (today), I kept tracking my package. FedEx web site always said the package was not ready to be picked up, but also said it would be delivered on Saturday to the location. It came to 7:30pm, the information was still the same. I decided to call again. Then, I WAS TOLD THAT IT COULD NOT BE DELIVERED TODAY. IT CAN ONLY BE DELIVERED ON MONDAY. THE REASON I WAS GIVEN WAS THAT SATURDAY WAS NOT BUSINESS DAY! But, it was FedEx's website that said the package would be delivered on Saturday to the designated location. So, either the FedEx website was lying or the representative was lying! FedEx does not know if they work on Saturday or not?! I asked for an explanation, but the representative only repeated that it could be delivered on Monday, and no explanation. It is really a horrible experience with FedEx. Not only they can not deliver the service they promised, but kept fooling consumers. They are lack of any sincerity, lack of professional attitude.

So I decided to wait outside after working 8 long hours, I sat from 8am-11:30am 3 days in a roll. My Package never came and the driver lied and said I was not home 3 days in a row. I was outside waiting from 8am-11:30am FedEx never showed up, the driver Lied and said they came but he never did. So then FedEx called and told me I can pick my package up from Twinsburg Ohio. Really :(. So I had the company ship me another package of the same item because FedEx refused to being me my package they were holding. The Company sent out another package, I was promised UPS was the shipper. Guess what? It was FedEx again. So once again after I had worked 8 long hours at work I sat outside from 8am - 10:50am package never came so I called because FedEx requested a change in Address without my permission. So I called FedEx they told me they were going to fix the issue right away and I will received my packager the next day. I then got all call from my Grandmother and she told me she had my table set. I said,"" What"" Why do you have my table set, and why did FedEx bring it all the way over there? So I called FedEx on 3201 Columbia Rd, Richfield, OH 44286 and demanded answers. FedEx called the local post office and looked up my previous addresses and changed my original address label that was on my package to an address I haven't lived at since I was a child. All because the damn driver was too damn lazy to drop my package off at my house because I lived in apartment building which I have two elevator by the way and I had two male family members waiting along with me to bring my table set upstairs. I had no idea FedEx had looked me up in their system and found out where my Grandmother lives and drop off a table set.

These people can't disconnect themselves from their corporate policies to fix their own mistakes. Instead of going the extra mile to make good for a situation caused by their own lax drivers, they prefer to have their, would be, cash generating customers bash their corporate image out here in cyberland.

Here goes, A package requiring a signature of an adult at my home is to be delivered. They try the first day, no success, doortag left. I can't leave a signature in the doortag for the next day because the other party demands an in person sign off. Not Fedex' fault here. Second and third day, I'm home all day. No doorbell, no knock, but there is a hangtag. Really? Hardly a good effort from a likely overpaid driver. I call them after the 3rd day because the doortag says final attempt has been made and no further attempts will be made.

They tell me there is nothing they can do. It is their ""policy"" to make only 3 attempts. I get it, this has to stop somewhere. They tell me that the final attempt was made at 1:30pm the 3rd. I tell them no way, I was home and there was no knock and no doorbell at that time. What are they training these drivers to do, sneak up at peoples door? I live in a very safe and open neighborhood with wide open front yards and no dogs. I guy that delivers packages doesn't need to be sneaking around.

So, they tell me they will make another attempt and we set it up for the following Monday before 4:30pm. They even send me a confirmation text confirming the delivery. I stay home all day to make sure I am there to accept the package. NO SHOW. Follow the tracking number given in the text and it confirms that they didn't even try.

Call them the next day to discuss. The package is sitting in the warehouse. I remind them they are the ones failing to perform as agreed. They send to escalation at corporate. They cave to whoever is in their Sacramento distribution Center. The package is sitting there labeled ""return to shipper"". I can come and pick it up before 7pm. 60+ minute drive each way with no traffic.

I get it, what a bunch of morons the shipper is to select this loser of a company to deliver their packages. OR, may this company needs to get someone from corporate down to the Sacramento location, clean house, and get some people in there who appreciate having job.

As you can see it was on a truck at 7:58AM and even though I was home all day and it was guaranteed delivery by 8PM the package was checked back to the local facility at 7:06PM.

Now what happened all depends on who you speak with... According to Jorge who I spoke to with the Verizon c/s person (Megan) it will be delivered by 9PM tonight because of the holidays. Whelp it's 9:23 as I type this so think that was a bunch of bull.

Now if you speak to Pat from FedEx, she says they had an issue with the conveyer belt and repeatedly apologized.

Of course once you get up the chain and speak with either Hugo or Rene (SALRC) they don't know what happened, took my complaint, gave me a ticket number, but feel ""very confident it will be delivered on time tomorrow"".

By ""on time"" I think they meant by 8PM just a different day. Oh yeah, have I mentioned that we fly out of town for the holidays tomorrow.

Thanks FedEX. Best believe I'll ensure NEVER to utilize your lack of service again!

I called the # going through a chain of automated commands that took forever, and finally got a human and asked if they could redeliver after 4pm the next day. Human said he will pass on the message. Next day, got a voicemail that Fedex driver cannot be there after 4pm, so my package went back to the fedex office and I should go pick it up. REALLY?

I got nice pics of the item, that was great. I paid on-line the shipment to France where I live and was really happy when I saw the expecting arrival date as Dec 16th. Everything was easy and fast. But wait
Next day my bank said the payment was successfully cancelled. I called Bongo for explanations. The person didnt know why they cancelled, as they usually didnt explain (who they?). He promised to check and get back to me (of course, he did not). I thought that I used my Russian credit card while in France, that might cause the alarm. I gave it another try and paid with my French card. The delivery date became Dec 19th, ok, still enough time before Christmas
After one hour Bongo blocked my account I called them again. The person said they might found something suspicious in my activity and blocked my account.
Well, I opened a ticket asking to reopen my account and provided all proofs of my identity, my address and even a copy of my credit card I used for the payment. No response. When I called them again it was said that they usually dont reopen accounts. The only option was to ask the e-shop to send a return label then Bongo could send the product back to e-shop. If not, after 30 days they destroy the parcel. What the hell?
Your NAME on the box you ALREADY purchased, your NAME in the shipping address and payment by your NAMED credit card may look so suspicious to Bongo that they block you.
Their member service is absolutely not professional and looks totally disconnected from the rest of the company (outsourced?). They always refer to some magic they.
Think twice when choosing them. This is worse than a lottery. In a lottery you at least know the rules.

562,ReviewRow-58,Totally impossible to contact FedEx,"I just fought my way through trying to set up some delivery options on FedEx's terrible website. The experience was about two steps worse dealing with typical electronic company tech support outsourced to India. First the website wants you to answer several questions to prove that you really are who you say. So it asks questions that the computer makes up based on some really really bad search algorithm that thinks it looks for public data like the names of people in your household, the size of your property, and the make of your car. Based on the FedEx reaction to my answers, apparently the make of my most recently purchased car was the ONLY question that they had right. They somehow managed to combine my grand-daughter's first name with her Ex-Ex-Ex-boyfriend's last name as someone they thought was part of my household. I don't know how big they think my property is, but I KNOW it is 0.68 acre, which is ""between 0.5 and 1 acre"" but they wouldn't accept the right answer. They they asked which of these names is part of your household and offered three or four names that I had never heard of. At one point they asked about people living in my house and the answer they wanted me to pick was another of my grand-daughters, but THAT grand-daughter has NEVER lived here. Eventually I managed to convince their insane computer that I am me; so then I got to try to set up delivery options. I can tell them where to leave a package (based on a list of options like Front Door, Side Door, etc - but no way to write-in anything) and no way to provide a notation like ""Ring Doorbell when you leave package on porch"" (which works fine at the UPS website). Then I wasted more time trying to contact FedEx to tell them about the above -- only to find that there is NO way to contact FedEx. Their Contact Us page has an option for Email FedEx, but if you choose that option you don't get an email address or even the usual web form to send them a message -- all you get is a way to search their FAQ (the FAQ is their idea of ""Email FedEx""). I even tried to call them on the phone -- of course you just get one of those damn voice menu systems -- when you finally convince the voice menu that you want a real person, it tells you ""We are currently experiencing an unusually high call volume, please wait for the next available representative."" The odd thing about this ""unusually high volume"" of calls is that FedEx is a business, the deals mostly with business customers -- I was calling at 3:30AM Eastern Time, when very very very few of their customers are awake. At least with UPS, you can reach someone and UPS usually delivers packages without running the package around in circles for two extra days after the first time it passes through your city.

I wish I had seen SiteJabber, before I placed the order, I still feel the same, if a web site, uses these people, or any 3rd party shipping/billing, I would recommend not to use it. Try contacting the site owner, buisness owner, directly first, and see if they will allow a direct payment to them, and handle the shipping. Also if you are a ""web store owner"", do not use 3rd parties to handle you business. I have learned now, best off completely avoid making any online purchases. The thing is, you pay them first, after they have the money, and your credit card number, who knows what will happen? There is to much risk involved making online purchases.

They have increased the volumetric weight of my shipments several times in order to overcharge me so other scam methods...

In february this year I requested them to ship a 2015 model TV which was worth over 2000 USD. I received a useless TV with a broken screen. They shipped the TV with no FRAGILE labels on it nor any sort of protection (Fedex tracking number: *******38585).

On March 4th reported what happened and their fisrt response was like we are not paying you (even though the merchandise was covered under Bongo damage insurance). After exchanging several emails they sent me a note stating that my claim was aproved and the claim amount to be paid was $2430. 27 USD. They also stated that the payment would be made via check and it could take 45 days to be processed (it was back in March).

I have been chasing them since then and now they do not even bother to reply to my emails anymore.

But when you track it the package gets to portland say on friday it will sit in whse till monday and it gets sent to Kent Washington (. 100 plus miles away north) and then it gets handed off to USPS. Who then reships it to portland to be resorted and shipped to the local carrier and finally gets delivered to you three days after it was already here in town First problem is if it doesnt make it fed ex says its not thier problem now its now a problem for usps to deal with
Second problem is the tracking number is no longer valid to track because usps puts thier number on it so now if its lost no one will take tesponsibility for the loss
Fedex told me they cant help and usps tells me the same thing
Besides the fact that it adds at least three days to it if it actually does make it to your house
FIRST OFF I PAID FEDEX TO DELIVER IT NOT TO PASS IT OFF
Also now rhe chances of it getting lost are now doubled
So why not just ship it thru USPS in the first place. It will save you all the extra days and they will be responsible if it does get lost or damaged. Right?
I will never use fedex ever again after my last experience i had with them
When i pay them to do a job i expect them to follow thru not pass or farm it out to another sub contractor am i wrong to feel that way

--Kinko's is good if you have your own artwork and layout

--Don't get the 90lb business card paper -- it's too thin. Consider getting your own paper.

--There's no minimum order, so if you have a small order, Kinko's could be cheap. But if you are ordering 1000+ cards, a real printing place is probably cheaper.

After getting crappy cards from Vista Print, I decided to try Kinko's. As usual, Kinko's is best if you can do everything yourself. I brought in my business card artwork in a Photoshop file, and they told me that it costs $16 to lay everything out, $15 to cut the cards (they print 10 to a page), and another $1.50 per page to printing including color, one-side, no bleed on ""business card"" paper (bright white, 90 lb). I decided to layout the cards myself (which was easy using guides in Photoshop) and have them printed on ""business card"" paper. The results were not bad -- the printing and cutting was fine. But the business card paper was too thin and flimsy. They said that was the thickest paper they had and standard for business cards, but if you use Kinko's I would recommend getting your own paper. The prices are OK, but the good part is that there is no minimum purchase. So 100 cards would cost $15 ($1.50 x 10 sheets) plus cutting or layout costs.

619,ReviewRow-486,Great Service for One with Disposable Income,"The Bongo service is very user friendly and simple to use. However, after ordering something small and using their service, I became aware that it is best for me to order something from Ebay that has been marked up by a reputable seller, but has reasonable shipping rates.

For anyone that has disposable income, buys from many different companies, chooses rare items that are not easily found on Ebay, Etsy or other resale websites, and wants a great, reliable shipping company to simplify the process of shipping multiple items from many different companies? This is a great service.

For me, it was best to donate the two products I bought to charity, then later order them again from Ebay, rather than to ship what I ordered. Yes, I could pay for my products twice + international shipping for the rates Bongo charges. But, I am happy to hear that they donate what I bought to charity, rather than putting it in the trash. This service really seems to be best for one making fairly large purchases of rare or hard to find items.

621,ReviewRow-257,FedEx Shipping=NOT TIMELY,"Well, if anyone looked by now at my sitejabber profile reviews, one would think I'm ""the customer that can't be satisfied""; but that couldn't be further from the truth.

Repeated & continuing troubles, mishaps & snafus bring on these reviews.

While I understand FULLY that nobody's perfect, the repeated instances from certain entities bring on my heated response.

Take THIS business for instace: FEDEX
I have an item purchased from another site (I've reviewed here on sitejabber as well) that involves FedEx (the subject of this review).
Item was purchased on March 3rd. Seller (through the other online site) made a shipment pickup call to FedEx for a rather huge 2 box shipment on the 5th. FedEx got around to getting it at its location in California on the 6th in the VERY LATE EVENING.
Projected delivery date via tracking (the 11th) wasn't going to work due to a conflict of me not being present at signing for the package & I decided to call the corporate office via the number provided on their site & see if the delivery could be delayed until the 12th. Odd, YES, but reasonable. So the projected delivery date was changed to the 12th/13th. Reasonable.

Now comes the problem.
My rather large packages have been sitting in California with a ""severe weather exception"" on them. They're ""parked"". FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS! After 3 phonecalls, I've finally convinced them to move the packages OUT OF CALIFORNIA the day before yesterday. Not to mention the weather has been great (although rainy) in my state of destination...& the freight has to move across the country. I won't see this package group until tomorrow (Tuesday) & I was told by the last operator (in his barely understandable Hindi accent... odd because they usually speak better English than most Americans I know) THAT THE PACKAGES AREN'T EVEN GUARANTEED THEN after he just ended the conversation & hung up on me with a ""so sorry, have a nice day""!
I haven't come CLOSE to yelling & being aggravated until NOW.

Basically, I'm told the item arrival MIGHT be in my state today for a POSSIBLE delivery TOMORROW.
This is FedEx.
Actor Tom Hanks portrayed Gary Nolan, a FedEx corporate obsessed with time who was stranded alone on a south pacific desert island in the movie CastAway.
One of the lines in the movie was:
""Time is a relentless taskmaster. If we fall behind an hour, an hour becomes a day, a day becomes a week... before you know it; we're the US Mail!""
Amazing how art imitates life.

GOOD GRIEF!
To make matters WORSE, this was $150 ""express ground delivery"" but my packages have been in California since the 6th. If that's ""express"", might as well be on Rip Van Winkle time.

Good thing this item wasn't vital to someone's life.

I just hope they didn't smash the boxes & its contents to $#*! & are unwilling to deliver them (another thing FedEx is famous for & has done to me on another instance).

This is absurd...& I guarantee anyone reading THIS I'm going to get every penny paid refunded to me... despite delivery.","March 16th, 2020",2,61,Tommy R.,3.0,2021-05-30 10:17:23.792231,2021-05-30 10:17:26.040623,FedEx,Sitejabber

All I had was the customer's Bongo number so I called (immediately got a PERSON on the phone) and told them the number and that we had to cancel the shipment. They said okay, they would return it if they could get a shipping label. They gave me an email address to send it to. I emailed them that return label and they responded, thanking me for sending the label and saying they would be sending the package back. EVERYBODY I contacted at Bongo was very nice, professional, and quick. We would have lost a lot of money if this disaster hadn't been adverted.

691,ReviewRow-413,Hello from OZ,"I had been recommended by a friend and this was the first time I had used your service. I have been extremely happy with the results.
My only problem was that I had given you a postal address and not a physical address not realising that the parcel would come by freight and not post. I was able to track the parcel and organise to have it delivered to my office so there was not a problem. My mistake.
The only other comment that I would make is that the supplier had put the goods in a box twice as big as it needed to be and the freight charge was quite expensive. The freight charge usually goes by cubic weight and because the box was so big it made a big difference to the cost. This is something I will take up with the supplier.
There were a couple of things on back order and they will come through to you eventually so I will need to give you the address to send them. Do I do this on your website.

693,ReviewRow-430,"Exactly what I expect, exactly as they promise","I don't do a lot of online shopping, but when I do, I often run into the problem of how to get my items to my current address in Japan. Many of my favorite items don't ship overseas. In the past I've relied on relatives, shipping to them so they can re-ship it to me, but eventually that starts to feel like I'm being a burden. Bongo (BongoUS) is the best solution I've found so far. Other ""re-shipping"" companies will ship things to japan, but only the things they stock. Bongo is the only company I know of that lets you gather a bunch of items over several days, stores them in one place until you are ready, and ships them out for you in as few packages as possible. When I need that service, Bongo is very convenient. And I like how they will photograph each item and any included invoices so that you can see basically how everything looks before it ships, just in case there are issues you see that need to be dealt with. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars, besides being reluctant to give anything 5 stars, is that this service is a little on the expensive side. They're up front about it of course, and their calculations are understandable. They have to pay for their employees and their warehouse and other fees, somehow. But the high cost still gives me pause. It's the only reason I don't rely on them more often. I would (and I have) recommend this service to friends and family if they're trying to find a way to ship things internationally that don't offer the option.

I should mention that, never having had a problem with my shipments yet, I do not know anything about their customer service quality or any issues concerning their returns policy. Never having any issues pop up is a good thing, of course :)

I stumbled upon a site called Autopartswarehouse.com and tried to place an order for parts for my Ford Explorer and BMW760.

However since I was ordering from outside the USA I was redirected to place my order through Bongo International because they are the ones that handle international deliveries.

My first reaction was that of concern at the prospect of being swindled by online fraud stars.

I went ahead anyway and placed my order on Saturday 10th August 2013, received my confirmation and my spares were delivered to my door step on Tuesday 20th August 2013 in Lusaka, Zambia; that's 10 days later.

I now have so much comfort dealing with Bongo and never worry when I place an order through them.

I highly recommend anyone to try their service.","August 23rd, 2013",1,2,leslie z.,5.0,2021-05-30 10:22:59.091585,2021-05-30 10:23:02.502258,FedEx,Sitejabber

I have only had good experiences with Bongo. I am in New Zealand and find it very handy to be able to send goods to Bongo at $ 5 shipping cost compared with $ 20 to $ 70 if I ship direct to New Zealand. Bongo consolidate my orders and allow me to pre-pay the tax so the shipment is fast tracked through to me in New Zealand. I just received my third shipment which arrived in 7 days which is fast for US to New Zealand. The key thing is to play by Bongo's rules. Never leave goods at Bongo for more than the 21 days allowed because with the number of items going through they can't afford to store them for longer. I build up a list of things I want and put all of the orders through at one time so that if one of the shippers sends to the wrong address there is time to sort that out before the 21 days expires. I did have an item break in one shipment but the Bongo insurance paid out on that no problem. Definitively not a scam and I will continue to do business with them.

I immediately had the impression that its gonna be a painfull process but again i was amazed that all i had to do was to send an email to bongo claims dept. Informing them about the damage and report it to DHL as well. From there on, bongo followed up claiming my money from DHL and all i did was sit down waiting for them to get me my cheque.
Prices are a bit high? Yes maybe... But again... They deal with DHL and DHL prices are even higher if u decide to deal eith them directly! Again...

The shipping of our goods from the USA to NZ was very efficient and everything arrived on time and in one piece. The process of having an account with Bongo Int'l and being able to check where our goods were at, at any point in time was fantastic. Our only concern was the cost of shipping, which we were not aware would be so expensive and to then be taxed in NZ for our goods. Bongo still provided a good service, albeit an expensive one, but we were aware our goods weighted quite heavily. We would use Bongo again but would love to know the rates per weight before agreeing to send to the Bongo addresses provided, so that we could chose not to use if too expensive and find an alternative.","September 3rd, 2015",1,0,Janine M.,4.0,2021-05-30 10:23:21.349789,2021-05-30 10:23:23.712479,FedEx,Sitejabber

That aside, I did actually have an okay experience with Bongo, though most of that was probably just luck. I ordered several things totaling almost 300USD from several different sites and they all arrived on time and were recorded on the log... When I went to ship them, the shipping cost ended up being a little over $100, which seemed really steep at the time but really, what other option do you have when they already have your stuff and quoted you a different to lure you in? Anyhow, they sent my package from the US on a Friday and it arrived in Asia on Monday. Couple of days dealing with Customs for some reason (either Bongo messed up or Korean Customs did) but my package arrived in a different box large enough to accommodate all of the items (though I was under the impression that ""consolidation"" was only available to paying members, so that was pretty nice) and there was nothing missing. Process time was very quick, though in those couple of days I nearly had a heart attack reading all of the horror stories online... In short, though my particular experience was good (albeit expensive), I'm too paranoid and scared to ever use them again. So many customers get screwed (if we believe what we read), and even if you have something or some things that you absolutely can't live without, perhaps it would be too risky to trust a company with a somewhat bad reputation in customer service... I was, of course, willing to gamble $400 on finding out the truth, and fortunately I came out alright on the other end. It's up to you. I gave it a shot and it was okay; others have and have gotten effed. That's life, I suppose.","August 14th, 2013",1,3,Ol B.,4.0,2021-05-30 10:24:10.997032,2021-05-30 10:24:14.213712,FedEx,Sitejabber
