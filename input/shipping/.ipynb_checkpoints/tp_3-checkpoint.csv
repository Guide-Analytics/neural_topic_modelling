Our account manager with Shipmonk, Michelle McCall has been very proactive when trying to resolve issues with our shipping problems.
She goes the extra step to find a solution and if she does not know, she will reach out to others to find the answer.
She has only had our account for a few months, but I feel secure and confident we have someone to go to when needed.
Thank you Michelle.

3,60a9c968f9f4870b700bb705,Immoral and unethical... STAY AWAY!!,US,"This company is terrible. I was a client with Shipmonk for 2 years and here are just a FEW of the mishaps I had to deal with.

1. Support tickets go answered for days, weeks, MONTHS then mysteriously get marked as Resolved. I have to open another ticket to get my issue addressed, most of the time it’s multiple tickets because they never answer them.

2. Special Projects go ignored. I submitted a request to label, repack and ship to Amazon FBA. It went untouched for 2 MONTHS. When I asked about the status they ignored me and marked it as Resolved.

3. I requested a wholesale order be palletized and shipped. Their website clearly states wholesale orders will be ready to ship within 2 DAYS. It went untouched for 10 DAYS until I followed up with them. Their LTL freight quotes were ridiculous. $492 for 3 pallets to travel 60 miles. I used my own freight forwarder and only paid $350. Do not use their freight forwarder, use your own. Then they charged me $192 to palletize 3 pallets of product! My second wholesale order they charged me $385 to palletize 6 pallets! (Most 3PLs charge $10/pallet.)

4. I created 4 wholesale orders and provided them prepaid UPS labels. They disregarded my instructions and billed me for shipping! I asked to be reimbursed because I provided them with PREPAID LABELS but they flat out said NO. I filed a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back. For unknown reasons my bank sided with Shipmonk and reimbursed them the funds. Then Shipmonk RE-BILLED ME for the exact same amount! Now they have DOUBLE the money they were never supposed to bill me for in the first place. I asked for a refund of the second charges but they refused. I even showed them the letter from my bank saying they sided with Shipmonk but they claimed they never received the reimbursed funds.

They also charged me $13.50 per carton to slap a label on it and put it out for UPS to pick up. (Most 3PLs charge $5 a carton.)

5. Three times they asked what I would like done with customer returns that were returned to their warehouse. I said ship them back to me but I never received any product.

6. They do not provide photos of customer returns so you cannot verify the customer actually returned the correct product. All you get is an email notification and you are at liberty to refund the customer. They could have returned a counterfeit item or a pile of rocks but you would never know.

7. Don't bother submitting a ticket when a customer package gets lost in transit. They do not respond. You can't even file the claim yourself with the shipper because Shipmonk has all of the shipping information and they will not give it to you.

8. They ""lost"" 20 cartons of my product and refused to reimburse me for the product cost or the supposed storage fees I was paying on it.

9. Closing my account was a headache and the process took over 5 weeks. TWICE they said they would credit my account if I signed their Closing Agreement which had a very detailed non-disparagement clause, meaning I could not say or post anything negative about them. Obviously they were aware I was upset with their services and were trying to shut me up. Sounds like a bribe! I flat out said NO I am not signing this. I thought my account was closed and then I got hit with their $250 monthly minimum fee on my account! AGAIN they said they would credit me the $250 if I sign their non-disparagement agreement. I said NO again and threatened to hire an attorney and pursue legal action if they didn't close my account immediately. That seemed to do the trick and I am finally done with these clowns.

Working with Shipmonk has been the worst decision I ever made for my business. They will fight you tooth and nail for every single red cent they can get out of you. They NEVER take responsibility for mistakes, it’s always YOUR FAULT. If you are doing wholesale orders, LTL shipping or Amazon FBA then this place is a nightmare to deal with. I do not recommend Shipmonk to anybody who is serious about their e-commerce business or their sanity.",2021-05-23T03:18:00.000Z,1,0,MB,1.0,2021-05-28 13:25:12.677177,2021-05-28 13:25:15.881885,ShipMonk,Trustpilot

11,60527c06f85d7503942d998f,DO NOT USE SHIPMONK - RUN AWAY NOW,US,"if you are looking for a new 3PL, let me just start by saying.... DO NOT USE SHIPMONK. There are so many better options out there and the biggest regret ever is that I used ShipMonk for the past 18 months.

This is my break up letter with ShipMonk and I couldn't be more excited to leave them.

Not only is the customer service TERRIBLE, but so was my fulfillment experience. They offer a nice online system to check on orders, but lets talk about the important stuff.

SHIPPING PRICES: One of the main reasons you use a good 3PL is to have the ability to take advantage of their cheaper / negotiated rates. Not the case here... rather than get cheaper rates, they are charging you more for every single carrier. I was getting cheaper rates using ShipStation back when I shipped myself. They are charging you as much as possible to just provide more profits for them, truly not caring for these small businesses they are providing services for.

2 DAY SHIPPING? RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM SHIPMONK!!!! In todays world, expedited shipping is becoming the new standard, and if you are looking to offer that to your -customers, MOVE ON TO THE NEXT COMPANY FAST. ShipMonk's 2-Day shipping cost was so incredibly high.. there were MANY cases where I would pay for their ""custom label fee"" which is $5, provide my own label via ShipStation, and it would STILL be cheaper than the cost they were giving me. How does that even happen? They offer 'DHL EXPEDITED MAX (2-3 BUSINESS DAY) and I did a report on all shipments that used this service and almost NONE made it there within 5 business days, causing me to refund SO many customers that paid extra for expedited shipping. I prefer USPS priority as I think the prices are fair, but they don't offer this for the 48 domestic states, only for Hawaii and Alaska which is the biggest joke EVER.

LOST SHIPMENTS: This past year I've lost over 100 shipments with DHL and other random carriers they brought on and they didn't care about replacing these orders or reimbursing those costs.

INVENTORY: I have hundreds of products so this was difficult, but I caught many mistakes on our weights and dimensions of products that were WAY WAY WAY OFF, which means you get charged more for shipping when you shouldn't be. You literally have to baby sit and monitor there every move to make sure things are done correctly, but no small business has the time for this.

STORAGE COSTS: There storage costs are pretty standard.. but want to know the worst part? They won't tell you what they are charging for each specific product. I wanted a way to see which product was being charged what, especially after selling through 90% of the inventory where maybe the product was in a bigger bin previously, and now I know it should have been moved to something smaller. I asked if I could get a report of all my storage costs, but they were unable to do so. Just said 'we don't offer that'. How are you generating these costs if you can't tell me what the cost is for each product?

PICK FEES: Pick fees are MUCH higher than the competition. You will find cheaper with any other 3pl, trust me.

When it came to closing my account, I was prepared to file a lawsuit it got so bad and I honestly wish I did. To 'close out my account and move my inventory' it took a whopping 35 days. You read that right.. 35 DAYS! That's 35 days of not being able to take sales. Thankfully - I had our best sellers already on Amazon so I could manually fulfil orders, but this is just a joke. Not only did it take this long to get my inventory picked up, they messed up NUMEROUS cartons mislabeling the contents and didn't label my pallets correctly.

I ended up leaving them to go with Shopify Fulfillment Network, but if you don't qualify for them, I highly recommend ShipBob. I received quotes from over 5 3PL's and if I wasn't going with Shopify, ShipBob was my next choice.

Now that you've read this long review, stop any communication with them as soon as you can! :)

Sincerely your customer you never cared about anyways,

13,603ed1bff85d750648fe5549,Overall a good company,BR,"Overall a good company. I've used other 3PL solutions in the past, and so far, ShiMonk has been the best. They are not perfect in my opinion, they have strengths and weaknesses. To me, their strengths are in the efficiency/speed to ship the orders, in the Customer service and software side of things. You always receive a reply from a happiness engineer really fast, and they are very polite and kind people, which makes the experience great. I also had to talk with my account manager to negotiate some prices, and he was super kind and open to discuss the prices, to keep us as a customer. The software/dashboard is good, with a lot of insights, nice UX, and it's easy to use and understand what's happening, even if you have lots of orders and SKUs.
Now, to the weak points. Fulfillment errors are not so uncommon as you'd like, at least in my experience. I thought they were happening because it was Q4, near the Holidays, but they kept happening when entering January and also February. The good part is that they refund you for those mistakes after you fill a claim, but this could happen much less in my opinion, because it definitely hurts your brand image if it happens too much (nobody likes receiving wrong orders). Another thing I don't like is the way they charge you for some things like Storage. It's confusing, and not transparent in my opinion. For example, my product is small, and is stocked in few units (most of the times less than 1000 units). It could theoretically fit their smallest bin for each SKU, however, I also pay for storage space for other bigger storage places. I remember asking about this some time ago, but I did not get a satisfactory explanation and I still don't understand why I have to pay for the bigger storage spaces if my product could easily fit in their smaller/cheapest storage unit. Other than that, everything is good. I would love it if they could solve those points, would easily earn a 5 star instead of 4. If you are on the fence, I think you should at least give them a try, overall it has been a good service to us.",2021-03-03T00:01:03.000Z,2,0,Raphael,4.0,2021-05-28 13:25:35.768415,2021-05-28 13:25:37.491458,ShipMonk,Trustpilot

Their closing agreement that they force customers to sign goes against the constitution and against the 1st amendment right. The closing agreement is a modification of the original service agreement. They know that nobody would sign when acquiring customers so they do a sneaky thing and force you to sign it at the very end when they hold your products a hostage. This is fully illegal and don’t let them get away with this. If you are a company that has experienced the same mistreatment by ShipMonk, make sure to reach out to an attorney regard this and make sure to sue ShipMonk. We canceled our account almost 6 months ago and we signed our “closing agreement” back in November. We missed two of our largest sales (Black Friday and Christmas sale) due to their refusal to closeout out account. We still haven’t received our products and we will most likely have to write them off as stolen. They also still charge us for storage. Whatever you do, make sure to avoid this company, do not remove your reviews and make sure to hire legal help. As an entrepreneur of 15 years I have never worked with such an immoral company.

Seems pretty unreasonable to charge someone $2,000 + storage fees in a few short months to have a few units in their warehouse when they didn't give me a stock count.

21,5ff75232755dc1032c0f06bd,Absolutely the worst!,US,"Absolutely the worst!

The experience with Shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars. The bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake. When you file a claim, there is no claim# or confirmation they rcvd your claim. It just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again. It's very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake. Here are just a few examples of problems that we've had where they refuse to take responsibility

1) shipping product that isn't our. we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies. Shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product.
2) shipping in the wrong packaging: We set-up customer packaging so some of our products would ship in poly-mailers. They told us this was set up and for a while it was working. For for the past month, instead of shipping in the correct package, they decided to ship in massive 20X20X12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times! Now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $7.00. We even worked with one of their VP's to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok.
3)taking months to fulfill wholesale orders. If you need to send items to Amazon in a timely matter, you can forget about it. It takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4) Not able to fulfill Amazon FBM. They repeatedly missed the deadline causing our Amazon account to go into ""high-risk"" and nearly being shut down.
5) Took 2 months to fulfill e-commerce orders. We all knew there would be delays during the holiday, but as of January 10, we still have orders from Black Friday that have not been fulfilled. To make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on Thanksgiving that just arrived this week and Shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order.

I highly recommend using any other 3PL. While it's true that all 3PL's will make many mistakes, most 3PL's will do the right thing. Shipmonk clearly has created a business culture where they will do anything to try and avoid taking responsibility for mistakes they made. It's a very shady way of doing business and I don't expect they will be around for long unless they drastically change how they handle claims and customer complaints.",2021-01-07T18:25:54.000Z,1,2,Andy,1.0,2021-05-28 13:26:03.188129,2021-05-28 13:26:06.349655,ShipMonk,Trustpilot

Read the contract! After their employees are done stealing your items, overcharging storage.shipping Bill's 2x what they should be you will want/need to leave. At which point they will charge you $2 or $3 for every product left in inventory (that they didn't steal yet) that you want to pick.

57,5e3f51423c93ae0b24a0ec3e,Heed these warnings...,US,"... if you like to stay in business.

We have been using Shipmonk for over 2 years. Their customer service is ok and so is their application but they will kill your startup with their ridiculous minimums and storage fees. To make it worse they you cannot trust what shipping they quote you, they will come back and charge 2 to 3X the original price quoted on the order. The latest example being charging $55 when the quote was $26. If I re-do the same order I am still shown $26. Its essentially fraud.

Also their minimum fees is a ridiculous concept. This is what I got from their support ""when storage exceeds $250.00 your minimum increases to the storage cost"". They already charge a premium on storage and they you end up paying 2X that because invariably your storage fees will cross usd 250 (unless you are shipping really small items with limited number of SKUs) and then that would become your new minimum, essentially doubling your storage fees. While they claim this crucial clause was always there on their website (we don't remember reading it) their sales agent never bothered to mention it during the initial meeting we had and it is not in our contract.

Also it is nearly impossible to know what you are paying for when it comes to storage ""their system"" essentially decides and there is very little visibility as to why you are paying of X number of pallets or Y number of bins. Also you would be paying for a whole pallet (X2 because of the minimums) even if you have 1 unit left on it and to make it worse you don't know so you can't do anything about it.

It is very hard to change a warehouse once you are stuck with one so do your research before you make the mistake we did.

Find someone else unless you love throwing away money. Companies like Shipmonk should go out of business so companies that do care about their customers can do well.

Echo in the line from a review below because we had to deal with the exact issue, thousands of dollars worth of lost inventory after they signed for it:
""Some examples: They lose inventory upon receiving, because they don't check what they sign for when product is delivered to them vs. what they actually receive and enter into the system. So when shipments show as delivered but the inventory is missing from the warehouse, their excuse is that they receive too many shipments to possibly try to check what was actually received. They have literally, on multiple occasions, lost thousands of dollars of inventory, and even when escalated to the CEO, refuse to accept ownership of this or do anything about it. And because they signed the delivery slip, you can no longer claim for a lost package from the shipper.""

We have hundreds of out of stock orders. The new inventory was delivered on Wednesday at lunchtime. It's now 9.30pm on Friday and not only have they not dispatched the orders, but they also haven't even put the stock in the warehouse.

I have called and messaged but have been constantly fobbed off and lied to with 'it's moving through the warehouse'. The truth is they are focusing on their bigger customers because they pay them more money.

We've been flooded with complaints and are busy issuing refunds when we should be focusing on sales.

Nobody cares, nobody listens. So I have no option but to voice my concerns here instead.

63,5dde1495c84545093cfa4f17,Shipmonk is THE WORST part of running a business,US,"We've been using Shipmonk for a year and half now and it has honestly been the most painful part of running a business. We thought that outsourcing fulfillment to them would make our e-commerce & wholesale business easier to run, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare at every turn. Shipmonk has good software systems, but really really bad processes, and the worst customer service (worse than calling your cable or phone company).

Some examples: They lose inventory upon receiving, because they don't check what they sign for when product is delivered to them vs. what they actually receive and enter into the system. So when shipments show as delivered but the inventory is missing from the warehouse, their excuse is that they receive too many shipments to possibly try to check what was actually received. They have literally, on multiple occasions, lost thousands of dollars of inventory, and even when escalated to the CEO, refuse to accept ownership of this or do anything about it. And because they signed the delivery slip, you can no longer claim for a lost package from the shipper.

They have extremely poor customer service - they literally do not care or do anything to fix it when they make mistakes, they make the same mistakes again and again, and have no escalation path. There is literally no one even at the highest levels that will address their process issues or the huge costly mistakes they constantly make. You can email the CEO and he couldn't care less.

They are ok with direct to consumer but absolutely horrible with wholesale. It takes 1 week+ to provide shipping quotes for wholesale orders, and you have to check on them constantly to make sure wholesale orders actually go out. They will change the order status to ""shipped"", and then never provide a tracking number, so you have to remember to go back and review all of your orders to ensure they actually went out. They send international orders using shipping methods that get sent back by customs, they package products in a way where they get damaged easily, and are bad with any kind of non-standard ask.

While some businesses are very customer service oriented, Shipmonk is at the opposite spectrum. Calling their agents ""happiness engineers"" is a literal farce.

If you think running a business is hard, try running one using Shipmonk. If I can give advice to anyone looking for a fulfillment center, it would be to avoid Shipmonk, and ask other services really detailed questions about how they handle issues.

I would give Shipmonk negative stars if I could, and ask for the weeks of my life back, that were spent agonizing over all the problems they've caused that have been ludicrous or impossible to fix.

In the end you just throw your hands up and say, well I guess they've lost a few thousand dollars of inventory again and won't do anything about it, and just move on for the sake of your own sanity, rather than engaging in another pointless conversation with an enragingly unhelpful agent or executive at Shipmonk.",2019-11-27T07:40:41.000Z,1,0,Jen,1.0,2021-05-28 13:27:36.699185,2021-05-28 13:27:37.867194,ShipMonk,Trustpilot

From shipping the products, doing special projects, to receiving wrong prices upfront and explanations on how their pricing working, from doing errors of shipping and errors of constuction. Bad. Bad. Bad.

Got through it and was smooth sailing (so we thought) until the freight charges started getting ""adjusted"" by the shipping companies. Turns out what ShipMonk call 0.9 lb is actually 1.05 lb so our freight rates effectively doubled which destroyed our margins.

We soldiered on but eventually grew tired of all the nickel and diming with 4% surcharges on all account payment methods except ACH payments, ridiculous ""packaging material"" charges (for standard size cartons and void fill) which should be part of the Pick n Pack fee and high storage fees due to the way they spread your stock out.

They also lost half a pallet of stock for a week or so (had to close Amazon listing and ShipMonk blamed their warehouse workers for it - great training there guys!) and we've had a number of damaged or lost shipments were the verdict was ""the carrier won't pay for that so don't bother claiming"".

So all in all, it is a very straightforward process and the only work you need to do is check their interface daily to verify no orders are ""stuck"" because the buyer entered an incorret address, or you have run out of stock of any item (which you shouldn't, as they provide a forecast on how many days of inventory you have left at the current sales rate.

All in all, very satisfied with their service and the timely delivery of the orders to my customers.",2019-01-16T18:20:05.000Z,1,0,Mikel Perez Isasi,4.0,2021-05-28 13:28:45.544957,2021-05-28 13:28:47.755105,ShipMonk,Trustpilot

95,5c02afcd9d37800a687ed10c,Was supposed to take stress off of my shoulders...,US,"We do shop updates and during these updates we receive about 1300-2000 orders in a 24-48 hour period. This was way to much work for just me & my husband to handle, yet we handled it.

Here I am a full week after the shop update and not a single f-@%%@ order has ACTUALLY shipped! All orders are simply marked as pre transit.

Even worse the tracking #s being kicked back into the etsy system are registering as invalid if customers try to track orders externally.

But on top of all of this they have not PICKED OR PACKED a single order in almost THREE BUSINESS DAYS and now I have about 100 orders that are marked late by DAYS to ship or are about to be!

Also I am having to refund people right & left as they say I am backordered on items even though we meticulously counted our stock with a clicker. Even on items we only sent 16 of they say we miscounted and only had 13... I'm pretty sure I know the difference between 13 and 16.

The first batch of inventory they right off the bat lost an entire bag saying we had miscounted and only sent 1 bag of a SKU that I had TAPED together.

So here I am with hundreds and hundreds of loyal customers who are pretty upset especially because I had to raise my shipping rates to use this service.

Then to add insult to injury they aren't even shipping chronologically! So add this to the backorder issue and we are having to refund people who bought things in the very first moments of the sale while folks who placed orders days later get the item!

By now be and my husband would have had at least 1000 orders fully shipped out, sure we'd be exhausted physically and emotionally from it but at this point it may have been less stressful than not being able to do anything to help our customers.

Also this was our holiday sale so we now have to shut down our shop early as we are worried any further orders will simply not be processed or shipped in time to arrive. So I will also be loosing potential sales.

You better believe this is also going to lead to some less than five star reviews for my shop too!",2018-12-01T16:00:14.000Z,3,1,April G.,2.0,2021-05-28 13:28:52.219117,2021-05-28 13:28:53.406668,ShipMonk,Trustpilot

Sure the content will make or break a subscription box, but if the fulfillment process is not executed with care and attention to detail, it would never succeed. My CRM not only “held our hand” as we were getting started (all new territory for us), she’s stuck with us every step of the way. I’m thrilled with Shipmonk.
