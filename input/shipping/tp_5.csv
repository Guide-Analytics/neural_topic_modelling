All our inventories have been moved with great care and zero damage until now. Hoping the same services for future as well. And, their charges are competitive as compared to other similar companies. Time wise, it’s as expected: A few days off estimated transit times and delays at customs, but come on people, did you not realize there’s an pandemic! This is why you plan your inventory and arrange your supplies restock schedules ahead of time with sufficient buffer. “Just in time inventory” planning is not gonna work when there’s a global disease that’s killed close to 500k people here in the US, and impacted millions. If you think your suppliers or service providers are responsible for keeping your products in stock in light of what’s happening, I’m sorry Buddy, but no - it’s your problem. Delays are gonna happen, so my advice to fellow sellers is to change how your planning your inventory and your restock times to account for a changing world. rant over",2021-02-11T14:17:55.000Z,3,0,Robert Gillam,5.0,2021-05-28 13:36:37.664442,2021-05-28 13:36:37.822021,Coshipper,Trustpilot

23,6011bd8f679d9705c85ba4bb,"BUYER BEWARE. Take a look at their ""positive"" reviews and the reviewers that left them",US,"TWO extremely poor experiences with Coshipper for my shipment from China to USA. Their quotes for their transit times are as true as unicorns and fairies. They may be listed on Amazon's vendors list for shipping but trust that it won't be long - they are absolutely the worst shipping service you could pick. Do not say you weren't warned - they will give you the runaround for any status you ask for after you pay (they do not provide third party tracking, just their own manual tracking which they update with any info as they please). Plagued with dishonesty and confusion, they do not take ANY responsibility for their poor services.

Here are some excuses (I received all 4) you may hear when the goods have not been delivered. Mind you they picked up the goods in SEPTEMBER 2020 and this is in JANUARY 2021:
1. We are unable to make a delivery appointment. We have been urging every day
2. The goods have already been delivered. When asked the date, they then realize it hasn't been delivered
3. The goods need to be dismantled from the shelf
4. The goods were stuck in customs for weeks causing delay

As another reviewer said, DO NOT FALL FOR IT! We have since disputed the payment on PayPal as they have lost all credibility. They are now trying to ask me to wire them more money directly to their bank account. What a nightmare. It will be an expensive and frustrating lesson for you. Don't learn the hard way.",2021-02-12T17:30:19.000Z,1,0,Cindy M,1.0,2021-05-28 13:36:48.760341,2021-05-28 13:36:51.958899,Coshipper,Trustpilot

Are there hiccups sometimes, yes, but honestly if you've been in the import and export business for any reasonable period of time (8 years for myself), you'll know that these guys are at the top of their game and offer truly something really different.

Also a tip, I've asked them to QC for any damages to my products before they ship out, and there have been no damages due to transit to the products either so far. My advise to some is to make sure you get the best packaging possible at the manufacture side, and to make sure QC is done before you ship out or else its very hard to find the ones accountable as your distributors or end customers are gonna complain to you if and when truth hits the fan.

This is one of those business decisions you scratch your head and ask yourself why you didn’t make this decision years ago. We are proud to call ourselves a client of Coshipper. Part of our problem was we had so many different business needs to attend to and not enough time to complete daily tasks. Working with Coshipper enabled us to spend our time on the other operational and marketing tasks, and less on sourcing and supply chain. I have 100% faith in this team. I’m quite sure I’ll be learning from them as the shipments keep coming in. This is a first class operation. If you have any doubts then I suggest you make an appointment for a visit at their office in Shanghai and meet these folks. I can now spend more time focusing on product development and marketing needs while they handle our China side consolidation and supply chain.",2020-10-24T16:46:20.000Z,1,0,Sherry Walton,5.0,2021-05-28 13:37:30.907553,2021-05-28 13:37:35.130447,Coshipper,Trustpilot

47,5f2ad7e21a5a690a04204f89,Bad experience...Disappointed.,CA,"We tried Coshipper because of these 5-star reviews. We selected the fastest shipping option which was supposed to take around 11 – 18 days and even settled the full cost initially. This was all to make sure that we got the best service that they could offer. Shipping was initiated in late June. Now we’re in the month of August and our goods still haven’t been delivered. This was a very sad experience for us considering this was our first try with Coshipper. We would like this issue to be resolved as soon as possible.

Update: The rest of the goods were delivered on the 19th of August.",2020-08-21T17:59:48.000Z,1,1,Francis Kene,1.0,2021-05-28 13:37:39.929883,2021-05-28 13:37:44.123141,Coshipper,Trustpilot
