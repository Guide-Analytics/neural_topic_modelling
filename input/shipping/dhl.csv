review-10475465,Verified Reviewer,"DHL apparently doesn't believe in delivering their packages. My package was sent from England, I paid a lot for my stuff and shipping. It was sent on a Friday and they had it on a truck by Monday for delivery. A week later they still haven't delivered it. In fact I signed online so in the event I wasn't home it could be delivered and one day the driver said attempted delivery, no one present. That was a lie, there is someone here EVERYDAY. THEN, they claim their drivers deliver up to 2130 hours (9:30pm), how is that professional? In my opinion, the driver should be fired and one of the supervisors should deliver my package personally.","May 17, 2021",3,"Brian of Blooming Prairie, MN",1.0,2021-05-26 10:49:20.024587,2021-05-26 10:49:24.193067,DHL

They were to be paid by ACH and I sent all the proper paper work, copy of voided check and W-9. Now you are telling me you haven't received the invoices or won't honor them because you received them through QB Intuit via email? I need a phone call from your AP department ASAP so this can be taken care of. Thank you.Why after 3 months are we only now finding this out? A real live person needs to call us with a real live answer, this seems like a canned response and delaying tactic. Do all the people that owe you money get the same “pay us when you feel it” luxury? We are a small business and have provided a service, paid our vendors and employees for what we provided you and now all profit from the job is going away.

review-10201061,Verified Reviewer,"DHL - Post codes confuse us. I’m only rating DHL one star because minus stars aren’t possible. I thought other couriers were bad, but DHL are without a doubt the worst courier I’ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I ordered a new phone through my business and the driver said my 75 year old house was “inaccessible” - at least that’s what the tracking info said. I rearranged delivery for today and the driver arrives over an hour earlier than DHL had texted, obviously at the only time I was out today. That’s when the fun and games started. The driver left the package on my neighbour's doorstep, then took it back, even though my neighbour asked him to leave it. He of course denied it, even though I have the footage in glorious 4K high definition.You cannot get through to DHL’s “customer service” until after the delivery time has passed. Now as he was early, by the time they condescended to allow me a (telephone) audience, this was already a good two hours after the driver had refused to leave the package with my neighbour (I might add at this juncture, that this was even after I confirmed that he should leave it with said neighbour).As my order was a company order, it “failed data protection” because it’s in the company’s name and not my own, despite the fact that it is run from my home address and I am a director (the wife is the other). Needless to say after this delightful exchange, my conversations with “customer services” would have made a sailor blush and would require a “15” certificate at least should they decide to listen to said calls for “training and quality purposes”. Training, maybe. Quality? Not from DHL, not by a long shot. On the plus side, as my business expands, I can tell you who definitely will not be couriering my parcels. I wouldn’t trust them to deliver a newspaper, let alone anything of value. If you’ve read this far, go elsewhere for your courier needs: anywhere will do. This is the absolute bottom of the barrel, so it’s only up from here.

review-10196843,Verified Reviewer,"Calling them was the worst experience with any shipping companies! I’ve got an insured express package supposedly arriving on a Thursday according the tracking!! But they said the address has no apartment #. So I updated online with the link they provided immediately shortly after I received the notification on the same day. And I called right after to confirm that they have the updated address. And I was told that they’d try to deliver on the same day if they have time if not it would be 8am-12pm on Friday. So then I asked what’s the end of day time they would deliver until? So just in case they had time to deliver on Thursday I will be there to sign it. They said 9pm. So I waited waited till 9pm hoping they’d make it. Well. It never came either on Thursday or Friday morning like they told me it for sure would!!!! Tracking status was also stuck on “exception” still inquiring about the address info!! So I called AGAIN Friday afternoon to ask what’s the scheduled date??? This time I was told for some reason it was not set to delivery yet and he will file a claim and he also confirmed the address info was received on Thursday (so then why was it not set to delivery?). So I asked if they could update the tracking status so I can get an estimated time??? The guy said they will and FOR SURE it will be delivered to me on friday. BUT informed if I don’t receive any tracking updates by 3pm to call again to check. (I really didn’t want to). So at 3pm I had to call AGAIN since nothing came and there was no updates no phone calls NOTHING!!! (Waited 2 days for this package while I could be out doing other important things.) So then, at 3pm I was told since the delivery change was made around noon (last time when I called) the package didn’t make it onto the truck and it was rescheduled to Monday! I was like... ""Ok I thought you said it will be for sure delivered today???"" So Monday came with all these frustrations dealing with lies from these customer service people. I CALLED AGAIN (so I could get some updates on an estimated time hoping I don’t need to stay home for the whole freaking day). They told me between 10am -2pm and now it’s past 4pm. I am sitting here still waiting and decided I should write this review... In conclusion, lessons learned. Never call DHL. They don’t know what they are doing or talking about! Just wasted my time calling 4 times just to get myself even more confused about the situation. I should just sit at home and just wait for it instead. :)

Package shipped from sending on Thu, Mar 25 with 3 day guaranteed delivery.

Package did not arrive until Apr 6th. I had to drive 2 hours to old address to pick up the package. I was proactive to notify them of issues multiple times and was promised multiple times that delivery would be ""tomorrow"" and to the correct address and it never arrived.

review-9998393,Verified Reviewer,"Let me be clear: I do a lot of shipping... DHL, UPS and FedEx. And I've had my share of problems with each -- including a recent problem with a DHL shipment to India. But I realize that some of the issues I've had may be more about the receiving NATION than the shipper. That said, I was a successful Fortune 500 Mktg/Comm VP and I learned the extreme importance of individual customer service. That awareness -- including my own high standards -- is what motivates me to write a review based on the customer service attitude of ""Aurora""... The woman behind the desk at my local DHL in New York City (886 Second Avenue.)When I go to the time and expense of bringing in a package for international shipment, it's always because I'm sending something important TO someone important. What impressed me was the way the agent, ""Aurora"", treated me and my needs... AND what I observed as I watched her handling the shipping of other customers ahead of me in line. She is personable and thoughtful. She REMEMBERED me and my preferences from previous visits...even with substantial gaps in between. Believe me, I'm not THAT frequent a customer. It's absolutely not that I'm so memorable; it's that THIS gal pays ATTENTION and obviously CARES about giving EACH customer the support they desire.Simply put -- if I were back in corporate life (God forbid!) -- this agent, Ms. Aurora, is EXACTLY the kind of person I'd want to hire. She's clearly intelligent, attentive, responsive, cordial...and always made me feel that my shipping satisfaction was something that mattered to her -- and that she'd do her best to ensure that DHL did its best. Again, I saw her treating other customers with the exact same care. I wish I could deal with people like her at Federal Express, American Airlines and a host of other large organizations that are important to me and my business needs. So it's because of Ms. Aurora -- with kudos to her boss for hiring her -- THAT'S why I had to take time to offer a 5-star review. She's superlative, plain and simple. As Tina Turner sang when I was much younger: for Ms. Aurora's customer service attitude and performance, she is ""Simply The Best.""

I told her I did 2 days ago and I could read the receipt number. She was rude. Since it was 2 minutes after the people left where the package would be delivered I asked how I would be notified. She said they would just show up. I asked when and her response was that she had no idea. I asked her to have them call me since today is December 23rd and my employees aren't working on Xmas eve or Xmas. She said they don't do that. I said, ""Well they texted me so can they at least do that when it will be delivered."" Answer = NO. They will just try another day. How stupid is it in this day and age to not call someone.

review-8812235,Verified Reviewer,"I used to think DHL was a pretty solid company in terms of customer service and shipping. I’m also not a fan of writing ‘bad’ reviews to businesses, but as a business owner myself, delivering with DHL has starkly decreased the reputation of my business in terms of unreliable shipping and snobbish customer service assistants. Not only was my parcel sent to Singapore held up at customs for 4-5 days, the DHL representatives in Singapore took forever to reply to my emails. Here’s what happened: When I first found out that my shipment was on hold, I immediately rang DHL Express’s customer service. The 2 representatives who served me told me that they’d forwarded an email to the representatives in Singapore and get them to contact me, that it was most likely a tax that I needed to pay. I was totally fine and understood the process at that point. I gently informed them not to contact me via phone as I would be on a flight the next day, and that an email would suffice. Not only did the DHL representatives in Singapore contact me by phone when I clearly told them not to, there was no link to pay my import taxes in the email as instructed. I replied them back kindly and told them to send me a link. I had to wait 2 whole days just for the link to be sent via my message (meanwhile my email hasn’t even been replied). After paying my taxes via the link sent, my package has still not been DELIVERED after a whole DAY. NO UPDATES were provided on my tracking package, and all they could give was “we can only deliver the next working day”. As of in 5 hours time by 12 midnight, this would mark 5 WORKING DAYS. I’ve even expressed that I needed this parcel URGENTLY. They, however, could not care less. This experience has been shocking yet eye-opening. I would highly recommend delivering via Royal Mail or Parcel Force or FedEx. DHL has disappointed me greatly. Please do not bother contacting DHL customer service for anything. Many of them aren’t trained and give generic, disingenuous responses. As a courier who once held high impeccable standards in the industry, they’ve sunk far down. The sad thing is they’re probably still keeping their noses high up in the air thinking they can conveniently blame “COVID-19” for every preventable mishap they have. This is what happens when a company becomes complacent.

review-8685605,Verified Reviewer,"You always truly know a company's customer service when something goes wrong, and you need them to solve it or at least make a fast sincere apology and a fair refund. Listen carefully to what happened to me. On November 5th, I shipped a package with some medicine to a friend of mine in Brazil because his little daughter suffers from a severe allergic reaction, and it was easier, faster and cheaper to get this done here in Canada than in Brazil, believe me. I tracked the package during the whole process and kept my friend informed since this important shipment had to get to its destination as soon as possible since we don't know when the next allergic reaction would occur, and they were running out of this medicine there.The package with this medicine worth CAD$ 408.87 was delivered on November 9th, which is pretty fast based on prior experiences. But to our unfortunate surprise, the package arrived empty. DHL in Brazil went on an investigation to figure out what happened to the package, but they didn't find anything. It took 9 more days to inform my friend in Brazil that they couldn't find anything there. They notified DHL Canada, and in a couple of days, I received an e-mail asking me to file a claim for formalities, and I did it immediately!At this moment, even though we were all sad because this simple task of sending a package with this important medicine was not accomplished because we all know that kind of things happens, we were tied to the hope of getting a fast, sincere apology and of course, the fair refund to buy the medicine and send it again. But guess what, it didn't happen this way! I have just received a call from a gentle and respectful attendant calmly saying that I would be refunded only CAD$ 3 and some cents calculated based on the weight of the package because I didn't choose to check the insurance option. I was frozen, not believing in what I've just heard. At that moment, I thought that was some lame prank. But that was what they told and offered me.It is unbelievable that such a big and renowned company, at least I thought it was, has this awful kind of policy.

review-8159924,Verified Reviewer,"Worst ""Logistics"" company I have ever encountered. I ordered a specialty item from Japan via Amazon. It arrived promptly in Austin. I was notified that they delivered it on Friday 7/31 - only they didn't. It took until Monday for them to find it - in their Austin airport office, with $41.79 import fees due. The payment link did not work however since the item had ""already been delivered."" Eventually they gave me a phone number to their Tax & Duty office. They could not make the link work either, so they took payment by phone and my bank sent notice of successful charges to DHL. They were supposed to send me an email receipt - they didn't. Then they could not schedule delivery since ""it had already been delivered"". So I drove to their airport office and the guy at the counter took mercy on me, copied my driver’s license and had me sign some paperwork. I took the package home. The next day DHL called wanting their $41.79 since there is no record of my paying it. When I told the lady that I had already paid and had notice thereof from my bank, she said that she hears that all the time from customers, but would have to send me a bill anyway. These guys make the US Post Office look like super competent geniuses. I would use ANY OTHER company for shipping & delivery, not these guys.

review-7967498,Verified Reviewer,"This review is about the ludicrous & unfair treatment, the constant lying & unhelpful customer service at DHL Mexico and the subsequent return of my package, which is looking very doubtful will ever reach its destination. On May 19th 2020, I contracted the services of the UK shipping service Parcel Hero. I had purchased online over the previous months, 4 bikinis, 3 men’s t-shirts, 2 lady’s blouses, a purse, a small measuring jug & to make up the weight and space, 4 packets of KP peanuts, (store bought & vacuum packed) each weighing 450g. I was covered up to 50 pounds sterling should my package fail to arrive, but to be sure, I paid extra to cover the complete value. Total paid for door to door service 54.01 GBP.The parcel was collected from my sister in the UK the following day, 20th. It arrived in Mexico City on 25th May. The status of the package was listed as “Uncontrollable clearance delay”. It stayed like this, and I had no correspondence from either DHL in Mexico or Parcel Hero in the UK until Monday 1st June. This is when I received the first email from Parcel Hero telling me the carrier (DHL) were trying to reach me by phone but the number is invalid. The number is not invalid, first lie. They provided me with an email address, phone number and name of the Import Agent at DHL, Diana Vanessa **.I tried to call, but was told she was not available, when prompted by the man I was speaking to, for my tracking number, he said the package would not be released due to the peanuts, saying food items are not permitted into the country. A second email from Parcel Hero came, this time, saying DHL had made numerous attempts to reach me but got no answer. Second lie. I had no missed calls, despite having phone switched on 24/7. Plus, if the number is invalid how did they manage to call me? I sent Diana ** an email confirming my phone number and address. She replied saying “because of the type of merchandise we cannot release the package, please share details of the broker or give authorisation to return”. I replied “I don't understand what ""broker details"" are? Please explain to me. She replied “It is to release the package via your personal customs agent”. I replied “I do not have an agent, my sister sent me the package using the shipping company Parcel Hero”. To which she replied “Then we can only send it back to provider.""At this point (and after various other attempts through various other channels) Seeming like I had no other option, I said OK. When I asked what the next step would be, she said “The return process starts, as soon as the tracking number is generated with which the shipment to origin will be shared to you.” I replied that on the DHL Mexican website “chat” (see below) I was told the peanuts were not the problem. I asked if they could open the package and take the peanuts out. He said they are not allowed to do this. She replied “The goods, all together require a series of permits, for that reason we cannot carry out the dispatch”. Upon further questioning she simply copied and pasted her previous reply “The return process starts, as soon as the tracking number is generated with which the shipment to origin will be shared to you.”I also tried to get a response from DHL Mexico chat online in their website. I was in communication with a lady called Gabriela. When I told her that I had been told the reason for not being released was due to the package containing peanuts, she responded “At no time would we say it is due to peanuts, but you do need to fill in forms from the Mexican Tax Administration Service”. When I asked for me details, she asked me for my email address then ended the chat. I never heard anything more from anyone other than Diana.I had called the number given for Diana 15 times, trying to get help and a resolution over the past 2 days. At one point I was told I needed to register with the Mexican Importation Agency. Upon trying this I learnt that this is for commercial and frequent large imports, it is not applicable to me, therefore I was unable to fulfil this impossible requirement. I then asked a friend who is a Mexican businessman if he would call Diana and see exactly what is required. She treated him the same way as she has been treating me, unwilling to help, just saying I need an import license. When he asked her to provide me with the way of getting this, she said the package is now in the process to be returned by request of the client and she cannot do anymore.
                        
                    
                        
                            Eventually, each time I got through to DHL, upon hearing my tracking number, they said “hold the line I will transfer you” Then the line went dead. Clearly, they were no longer willing to provide me any courtesy. Because of this, at one point when I got through, I said “before you ask me the tracking number I have just one simple question”. The man agreed to listen. I asked how long it takes to prosses a return order? He replied 20 to 30 days. Determined to leave no stone unturned, I also tried getting help from DHL Mexico on WhatsApp. This was met with automatic robot replies. No help whatsoever.I also tried DHL Mexico on Messenger, also automated response from a robot. Fruitless!I also asked a friend whose brother works in Mexican Customs. He could not help as it is in the hands of DHL Customs, but he did say there are no restrictions on peanuts, and that they are allowed to open packages and remove items not allowed. His siter told me she had a similar situation with a package sent by DHL from Germany to Mexico. It contained a particular spice that was prohibited and she told me she instructed them to remove it, they did so, and she received her package.Meanwhile, each morning I receive an email from Parcel Hero telling me the carrier has not received the information required from me, and if I do not supply it within 72 hours, they are not responsible and the package will be sent back. This is despite the statement in one of their emails “Please notify to shipper that customs will not allow RTO (Return to Origen) by type of product”. So, on the one hand Parcel Hero say it will be shipped back within 72 hours, on the other hand they state RTO is not allowed. And DHL say I need to give them permission to send back, AFTER Parcel Hero tell me it will be sent back within 72 hours, regardless, if they do not receive the information.
                        
                    
                        
                            Today I see on the tracking update on the Parcel Hero site “Returned to shipper”. On the DHL tracking website, it says “Returned to origin”. So I sent Diana another email asking for the tracking number. She replied “No tracking number is generated yet for return to origin, the process takes 12 to 15 working days.”If indeed the package has been returned, surely there must be a tracking number?This morning, another Mexican friend in Mexico City tried to help by calling Diana. This is what she wrote to me… “Hi Pauline, after calling many times without being able to contact Diana, I called again and begged another woman to give me reports of your package. She simply told me that your package is already in the process of being returned and that the interested one (that is you) had given permission. I asked her if there was no other option and she replied that NO and that the problem with the package had only been peanuts because they do not bring ""presentation for sale"" (they never told me what that means). The truth is, I feel very bad for not being able to help you and the worst, that the people here do not lend the same to help the client, quite the opposite in fact.So yet another conflicting reason why the package was not released. I have never been told by DHL, this was the reason, quite the contrary, I was given 3 others conflicting reasons. Parcel Hero never advised I would need to provide a sales receipt for the peanuts. Nor did they advise me personally or on their website that I need to hire a personal broker to receive a package of just a few personal items. Why? because it is not needed. All of this is just lie after lie & excuse after excuse on the part of DHL Mexico.Diana Vanessa ** should not be in the Customer Service business. She does not know the meaning of these words. From the outset, it was clear through her curt words, her unfriendliness & unwillingness to try to help, that my package was doomed from the time it got to DHL Mexico. I ask you; For, 4 bikinis, 3 men’s t-shirts, 2 lady’s blouses, a purse, a small measuring jug & 4 packets of KP peanuts, do I really need to register with the import authorities? Do I really need to fill in a tax form for commercial business? Do I really need to hire an Import broker?

review-7900661,Verified Reviewer,"I ordered from a company that shipped to DHL. My product never arrived. I checked the status of where my product was everyday and finally I see a ""delivered"" status on the website and all I saw was red. Where was my package that was so called ""delivered???"" I called DHL and they basically fake investigated for four days saying the driver is trying to find out where they delivered the package and called me a liar even though there's no signature on file and no picture of my product and no sign of a delivery driver trying to explain (but I'm a liar right?). (What happened to the customer is always right?!) Well anyways to show them I am telling the truth I asked them can they deliver the product again another way instead of refunding me the money. They said they don't owe me anything and that I need to contact who I ordered from because that's who I paid. WHAT?!!! There's no signature!!!! Oh yeah and I wasn't even home!!!! And who was the delivery driver?!!! I called daily in the midst of this pandemic. I went through pure hell everyday trying to find out where my four packages total of $279.04 had gone! NOT ONE BUT FOUR!!!! With them not calling me back I'm constantly leaving messages and all they're doing is leaving notes in the system that I called and that's it. Even when I called 5 times a day every single time I called you can bet someone said they would call me back by the end of the day or they would say someone was supposed to call me but didn't. Wow.They even admitted they might of delivered to the wrong address and then they said no one was home so they just left my package there and they said that's authorizing if thats even the truth considering there's no signature on file that anyone signed anything. I don't even have a picture of my product sitting on the porch or anything like they do for efficiency. Nope nothing. Thank God I have a good bank because they gave me my $279.04 and I guess dhl will owe them money. Good. I can see if you lose 1 package but all FOUR?!!! They wouldn't even let me talk to the guy that ""delivered"" my package. I stopped dhl long time ago. I usually go with Amazon because I always get my product freaky fast but I wanted to give dhl one last chance and lo and behold it never fails. They're always about themselves. One lady even actually raised her voice at me and told me they delivered it (no proof) and that I need to call the company I bought from because they owe me money not DHL. Well no they don't. They did their job and just because I didn't order from dhl and give them my money they say they owe me nothing. They didn't even try to satisfy me in any way. Product just out there somewhere and money gone down the drain in the midst of coronavirus. How is this a delivery company when they cant ""deliver""??? I'm surprised they are still in business!!!! I dont see a great future for them. Last lesson learned!

review-7895648,Verified Reviewer,"I ordered something that shipped out of Kentucky and was supposed to arrive in Alberta, Canada (Express 2-day shipping). Order left Kentucky and reached Canada in a timely manner. I made an account with DHL so I could change the delivery address (change to my workplace) the day I received the tracking information (two days before expected delivery). I received a confirmation email stating that the changes went through. The day they were supposed to deliver my package I received a notification saying that delivery was refused because nobody was there to sign for the package. Turns out they tried delivering the package to my home instead of the address I requested.I call in that day and was promised it would be delivered the following day to my workplace. I receive an email that night saying my package was being held until I make a duty/brokerage fee payment (these were already paid when the item shipped from Kentucky). I call back in and was informed that there WASN'T any fees required and that the package would still be delivered the next day (one day past the paid for 2-day express shipping). I see no change on their notification system the following day, and I call back to see what is going on. Finally spoke to a supervisor who states that there is a notification saying that it must be held until fees are paid, but there are no actual fees listed. I was told she would look into it and get back to me. The supervisor never got back to me. I get forwarded to a ""specialist"" who tells me they are going to look in to what is going on with this package, and that they are going to get in contact with me tomorrow. Timeline of events: 1. Ordered product on Friday, package was sent out that day. 2. Received tracking information on Monday. 3. Changed delivery address to my workplace on Monday. 4. Delivery attempted on Wednesday (which was in line with 2-day Express shipping) at wrong address. 5. Called in to figure out what is going on on Wednesday, told it will be shipped to my workplace the following day (Thursday). 6. Receive notification that package was held until receipt of fees payment on Wednesday. 7. Called in again and was told there were no fees required and that it would be delivered on Thursday. 8. Not delivered on Thursday like I was told, called in to speak with a supervisor who forwarded me on to a specialist. Told by specialist that they would look in to it and get back to me the following day (Friday). It took one day to travel from Kentucky to Alberta, and has taken 3 days to travel less than 150miles and I have had nothing but frustration.

Contact DHL , their answer: ""DHL is not delivers to Russian physical persons, only to companies.!!! So, their office get the package, take the money, deliver to the Russian borders and back it immediately. (No contact to me or sender). So DHL not delivers, but take money and ""try to deliver"". Awesome. And of course they not returns money. (It's dhl miss I think, that they take it, when they knew that will return it).2) Deliver inside the Germany. Changed conditions. If you use ""deliver partner"" must point in the name ""firm name"". So if sender no point it, then DHL get it, deliver it to the point and return it to the sender. For me: in company works for the people, then: in 1st case, their office no take package to shipment or, after this situation happens, they take money back. In 2nd case dhl may just made one call to the sender to fill necessary string and deliver it, but they select get more profit, by quite return.

review-7705313,Verified Reviewer,"Extremely Bad DHL Service in Istanbul. I have been living in Istanbul for the past 6 months. During this time I was ill three times and I could not manage this illness. I did not go to a local doctor because they overcharge people and they dont speak English so communication is difficult. The last time I was very ill with symptoms similar to the corona virus. The pharmacies here do not have excellent vitamins. So I decided to ask my brother who lives in Australia to send me good vitamins, Vitamin C, Cod Liver Oil capsules and an Immune boost vitamin. With the corona virus being harmful. I wanted to protect myself in the long term rather than always having to depend on antibiotics.My brother lives in Brisbane so on Feb 18 he posted a a package to me with these bottles of vitamins. He sent it DHL express from a local post office in Brisbane. He sent me photos of the bottles of vitamins and the package. Tracking Number-**. DHL waybill No- **. He also sent a number to call here in Turkey which the local post office in Brisbane gave him - +903124491000. My brother said that the package will take about 4 days to arrive. On the package is my full address in Istanbul and my Turkish mobile number.Four days later I did not hear anything about the package. I thought that the package may arrive at the local post office in my area. So a week later I did visit this post office in Uskudar and the guy who I spoke to put in the tracking number on his computer and told me that the package is not in Turkey and maybe it will arrive the following week.The following week I went back to this local post office and was told that I need to go to the postal head office in an area called Acibadem. So I went to this post office and they put in the tracking number in their computers and found nothing. I asked one of them to call the number my brother gave me but this number was engaged. I spoke to another friend to call the number in Turkey and he finally said that someone spoke to him and said I need to wait another day and if I don't hear anything than I must write a petition to the head post office about the fact that I did not hear anything about the package. I still received no sms to date or a phone call from DHL - there was no letter or note from them requesting me to come to their office.On Wednesday 11 March I decided to visit the DHL head office - DHL Express Yalcin Kores Cad. No:20 34212 Yenibosna/Bagcilar, Istanbul-Turkey. I explained to someone there about the package my brother sent me and provided the tracking number and the waybill number. Then this female staff member told that the package had arrived on 21 Feb and that they have been trying to contact me.These are lies because there are no call logs on my phone from them and neither is there an sms from them. Then she said that they were getting ready to send the package back to Australia. If I wanted the package then I would have to pay a minimum fee - 20% of the total amount of the vitamins. But they will also investigate the original price of these vitamins and charge me an amount on this. And I have to get a doctors letter from my area stating that I need these vitamins like a prescription. All of this I had no idea about at all. There is nothing on their website about this..So I told that I will not pay for the vitamins and will not get a doctors letter so they can send the package back to Australia. Then she said I would have to sign letter confirming that I would like the package to be sent back. She said she will send me the PDF letter to fill out and to send this back to her. Her email address is **. Later that afternoon I checked my email and found that this letter stated that the package was mistakenly posted to me and therefore must be sent back. These are lies! So I wrote her back and that I refuse to lie and will not sign this letter. I have not heard from her. I have no idea where the package is and I have not seen it at all since it arrived in Istanbul.

review-7516652,Verified Reviewer,"I have an Express shipment with DHL for almost 1000 USD shipment cost. Still in transit from the US to the Philippines since December 18th and here the chronology of events: The shipment arrived in the Philippines on December 24th after 6 days - which is okay. On that day I have been informed by DHL that they need an affidavit of ownership from me. I told them that I can't do that before Dec 27 because of the holiday but they urged me because after 5 days it would be flagged as abandoned. I provided the affidavit notarized on December 27th - 2 days before the 5 days deadline. And I thought that I am okay now. I was not. Seven days later on January 3 I got an eMail from DHL requesting the invoice and the proof of payment which I provided to them within an hour. On January 9 I then got an eMail with the duties/ taxes and fees listed with the request to confirm that I will cover all cost. The cost included about 90 USD for warehousing at the customs. A service representative told me that they only move forward if I agree to cover all cost. The bad service of DHL caused the 90 USD addtl cost and not me!! But of course I agreed to cover the cost because I was threatened that the cost will increase and the shipment does not move if I don't agree. How would you call this? Extortion? The shipment was then released from customs on January 9 - it took DHL 16 days to process the customs declaration. On January 16th the shipment was still with DHL and I contacted customer service. Now I was told that I have to pay another 784 PHP (USD 15) because they have to repackage it for delivery from Manila to Iloilo as the shipper did not package it correctly. Oh my God - DHL accepts a bad packaged shipment and sends it to the Philippines and there they notice that the packaging is wrong. And of course I have to pay because otherwise it does not move or is moved in a bad shape. How would you call this? Extortion? Even this did not help. The shipment is still on hold waiting for the next movement. I contacted them several times by phone and eMail and I always got the standard response ""we apologies for all inconveniences"". I started a complaint yesterday and got again an apology. They wrote that there is a flight confirmation for Monday from Manila to Iloilo. Note that there are many flights each day. By all means avoid DHL for shipment because their processes are inherently flawed. You might be lucky and the parcel arrives in time but if there is a problem then their processes will make sure that the customers will get an even bigger problem.

When the last item I received actually arrived in Xi'an I was told that the courier could not find the address.

They send you an email automatically that allows you to input the required customs and ID information and they have local pickup points rather than one central office.

Paid the 58$. They said, ""Thank you. Your parcel will be delivered in 48 hours..."" 8 days later and many many phone calls later still no parcel and no one can tell me where it is.

They never let me know the shipment was in Canada, no delivery as usual and no contact. They sent the shipment back saying I did not want to pay for it! Liars!! I did finally get the shipment two months later and the entire contents was destroyed. They added a note to the package saying that the lids came off in travel. The lids are locking and every jar was smashed, along with shampoos and bamboo tooth brushes that were broken in half...not an easy feat!!

review-7328726,Verified Reviewer,"Update to my original review. My package did arrive today, the day after my original post. Overall shipping time from Ukraine to US was very fast (6 days door to door), but I needed 8 days total to receive it due to previously mentioned issues. Still, for express overseas shipping that's pretty good indeed. I contacted customer service enough times to have a sense of their support abilities, and overall the easiest way to put it is that they do the best they can with the information they're given. One of the last reps I spoke with said it best; ""We can't do the drivers jobs for them, all we can give you is the information available to us"". Contrary to some of the other reviews on here (that seem to be totally fake by the way), customer support has no way of contacting the drivers or geo-locating their position. Maybe this would change if you spoke to a manager, but as far as base support goes that is just the reality. For the small amount of info they are given, I think they did a very nice job dealing with my (sometimes) dramatic phone calls. I needed my package for work by today, so I was beginning to panic a bit. Updated review includes +2 stars because they did attempt to initially deliver my package 6 days from purchase. It was only after leaving the ""sorry we missed you"" slip on my door that the delivery hiccups began, but all in all they smoothed out within 24 hours. One important piece of info I also have is that signing on the 'missed you' slip to allow them to leave it without a signature does not guarantee they will do so. I was told that the seller actually disabled that feature on their end, so be aware of that possibility if you find yourself in a similar situation. Fortunately this is something DHL can check, and I'm glad they did tell me, otherwise I may still find myself without my package.Original review: Dec. 4, 2019I probably should have checked out the reviews prior to ordering my item, but upon doing so I had to go back over four months to find a review that gave them more than a single star. Not a great look for this company. I ordered a camera lens from Ukraine to US and paid more for express shipping than I did for the actual piece of equipment. It being an Amazon purchase, I was unaware it was being shipped via DHL. On Monday I arrived home to find a 'sorry we missed you' slip on my door. The package required a signature so they said they would deliver it the next day. No problem, things happen. The following day I came right home from work because I was given an estimated delivery time of 2-4:30pm. I contacted customer service four times between 4:30-9:30pm. Each time I got a different person, and every single one guaranteed me that my package was on the truck and that I would receive it that evening. I was told it was their peak time of year and they had a lot of packages out, so it may come later in the evening, but I would definitely receive it. At 9:24pm I find out via tracking that 'package undeliverable' was posted. Upon further inspection I was told that the package never even made it onto the truck for delivery today, even though I got a tracking update earlier in the day that said 'package out with courier'. I asked why I was guaranteed multiple times that I would receive my package today if it wasn't even on the delivery truck, and was given vague info about them only being able to see what was on their screens. They asked if I would like to schedule delivery for the next day (Wednesday). Since I have no choice I said yes, despite having gone through this exact same process the day before. The lens was time sensitive and the reason I paid as much as I did for express shipping. I will update this review if I do in fact receive my package tomorrow, but at this point I'm not exactly filled with confidence. I don't blame the customer service reps, it seems they are given very little information to work with. It seems to be a bit misleading even on this site, as unless you filter reviews to 'most recent' you get glowing reviews from people claiming customer service was able to contact the drivers and arrange special accommodations for them. This is 100% misleading, as I have been repeatedly told that there is no way for customer service agents to contact the delivery drivers. Holding out hope that I actually receive my package tomorrow. I require the contents of my package for a job that literally is tomorrow evening, so if I do not receive it in time I will be making inquiries into this company via the Better Business Bureau. I hope to update this review with a positive conclusion, but the number of negative experiences I have read does not leave me all that confident about that prospect panning out.

review-7317662,Verified Reviewer,"This shipping company is the worst. My honest opinion I wish they go out of business already. This is my second time having to receive my order from them and the expectation you at least try and give them fails every time. With every shipment no matter who delivers I set up text notifications which is what I did with DHL. The first time I had an order come from DHL it was delivered on the same day it stated it was to be delivered. Cool. Once my package stated out for delivery I was all eyes into my delivery status. I rushed home to sit and wait for my package, and a few minutes later I get a text msg stating that my package was undeliverable, immediately called to see why my package was undeliverable and the agent stated it was b/c I didn't leave a gate code. I informed her it didn't give me that option or to leave a # if had any questions, so I asked if they could redeliver since it was just a minute ago and I can meet them at the gate.He stated that he will expedite my request and someone would get back to me. No one ever got back to me, and I get a msg stating my package would be delivered next business day. I was furious. I got my package, but fast forward ""NEW PKG DELIVERY STATUS"". Based off my first bad experience I looked into DHL a little more an their delivery options. When you create an acct with DHL you're able to set your delivery preferences well so I thought, so I set my preferences once I created an acct. There was a no signature preference and option to choose when you're not able to sign.You get three options. I set two of them in the case I'm not able to sign for my package and this delivery was the case and I needed my package the day it was delivered. FYI they don't use any of those preferences you opted to choose, so I get my notifications and of course it stated undeliverable for sign bc I wasn't home, but surely I thought they would exercise the other two options I chose which was to leave with my leasing office while they're open and if the driver doesn't deliver when the office is open to leave on my back patio and also left a # to call with any questions. They just refuse to use my other options that they allowed me to set. So I called customer service. They told me my package was undeliverable, I asked they why they didn't use the other options. They proceeded with ""I don't know"" and will expedite my request to speak to a supervisor. I asked will I be able to speak with some today they told me yes. I hung up.3 hrs pass no call, so I called again informing them that I'm supposed to be waiting on a call, they told me again, ""Just wait. You will get a call today,"" they even promised. I didn't believe that but how do you train your agents to promise something they have no control over. Sure enough I didn't receive any call, until the next morning then they were closed I missed the call and I could call back. The woman left a message stating I won't receive my shipment 'til the next working business day, when it was their fault that they didn't utilize the other options when delivering my package. This company is a joke and I hope they lose business and GET SHUT DOWN!!!

Later I had to repack that box again in DHL service point because I was asked to open sealed box again (I understand that they had to do that for security reason).After I send my parcel in few days my dad has call from DHL and they explained that it's forbidden to send food in Mexico form EU, so they need to remove those sweets. We agreed (however nobody in DHL wasn't advice me do not send sweets in Mexico). Few days later my parcel was attempted to deliver, however courier was asked my dad to pay duties, which was marked in delivery statement I was signed, however DHL customer service desk should mark it CLEARLY that you have to pay duties or taxes.

Bottom line: they delivered a package to the wrong address, insisted they had delivered it to me, did not follow-up after I called twice, and four days later, when an elderly neighbor up the street brought me the package, they still insisted that the driver had delivered it and left it behind a plant. I finally received an apology call, and after that, another call telling me it had been delivered to me! Poor technology, poor employee training, poor follow-up, not to mention a driver who can’t read street numbers. Everyone makes mistakes, but this was handled so badly, I felt the need to report.

review-6777083,Verified Reviewer,"Updated on 09/09/2019: I've already been having a lot of issues with this company when I called to see where my order was they told me someone tried to deliver. I was home all day long waiting because it said my stuff would be delivered today. They told me that there was a confusing with my order, tomorrow it'll be a week and they said their ""fast"" shipping is 3-5 business days and I've been waiting over that. I just want my clothes and I will NEVER use this company again.Original Review: I just had the most horrible experience with this shipping company. The girl on the phone she didn't even give me her name and she was so rude, argued with me the whole time and was no help, when I asked to speak with someone else she told me they would just tell me the same. When I ordered from Fashion Nova and I decided to get fast shipping because you know fast shipping is usually fast but they tried to deliver 1 piece to my house and charging me 108 dollars when I have 14 other pieces coming. Are they going to make me pay that for every piece I ordered? When I placed the order there was nothing to tell me I would be charged another 108 dollars by this delivery service.I have already been waiting since Sunday for this and they are telling me I now have to wait till Monday till the delivery and are trying to get me to pay 108 dollars and only one of the things I ordered will be here. I did not get to ask questions to the lady who I was speaking with on the phone because she was rude and very unhelpful. When I called fashion nova they told me they had nothing to do with the fees and when I called the delivery company they said that it was fashion nova's fault they should maybe come in contact and connect with fashion nova since they deliver for them and inform people they are a lot of extra charges at the door with your package, so upset with this company.

The phone was given to a DHL person who wrapped the phone with one wrap of bubble wrap and put it in a box large enough to send more than 30 phones in without inside protection. DHL lost the package and made it impossible for me to contact them. I did email DHL in the US but they said I had to speak to DHL in Mexico and three times the people who contacted me from DHL in Mexico seemed to insist I speak Spanish to them though told in Spanish I do not understand Spanish. After several emails, I had to contact the person in Bangkok who was going to receive the phone to contact DHL in Bangkok.. That person spent more than 20 hours waiting for call backs, on telephone voice trees and emails with DHL. End result, no delivery. About 4 weeks after the package due date in Bangkok, I contacted DHL CEO John Pearson email (DHL made it impossible for me to contact anyone else) who had someone from customer service contact the person to receive the package in Bangkok. HEY, I sent the package, why wouldn't they talk to me. The VP of customer service got the name wrong of the recipient in emails and didn't bother to express regret for it. No wonder the package is lost if a VP can't get the name correct. To add insult into injury, this VP was insistent on getting my number and calling me even after he was told at least a few times I do not take calls because I am hearing impaired. This fiasco from DHL took 20 hours away from community service projects which serviced the youths, our future.DHL's was unprofessional at every level and their motto ""Simply Delivered"" should be changed to ""We simply fail."" After posting my dissatisfaction with DHL every day on social media, I will contact the Guinness World Records to see what is needed for the record which will give DHL the advertisement it deserves.

review-6127798,Verified Reviewer,"This is my ongoing story with DHL which is still unsolved till this moment on Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; I made my shipment with receiver name and address as DHL officer ask on May 28, 2019 at 14:31PM. Later after three (3) days on June 1, by accident, I found out from DHL tracking system the shipment is on hold. From the next day I handed it to their officer (June 29) and since then no one care from DHL officers to call me though they have my mobile number and E-mail.Immediately, I called, but it took more than two (2) hours with many many re calls till I was able to reach their officer. Their line is fully busy and their communication system shut me out several times while I was on-hold awaiting someone to answer. When, at last, I talked to DHL officer complaining on the slow service and no one care to call back as soon the shipment was hold which means wasting 3 valuable days of my shipment delivery. The only answer she had, that I can raise a complain, which means more time/days to waste. But I told her, we approach DHL and paid more money to have fast and safe delivery. I asked her to put me through a responsible supervisor, trying avoid more delays. She said, ""I cannot, I can raise a complaint request only.""When I insisted, I found myself, suddenly out of their communication system. To reach back, I need to work 2 more hours. At last, next day, after 24 hours and total 4 days from shipment date, June 2, their representative call apologizing for the delay. I gave him the passport copy of the receiver full and promised to follow up to expedite. Next day, after 24 more hours and now total 5 days from shipment, June 3, DHL tracking STILL SHOW HOLD STATUS.Immediately, I call back on the telephone number the representative called me yesterday when someone else answer and I had to re-explains the full story who They put me on hold and later mentioned that we have to return back the shipment since you can not provide ID of Receiver!!!! and don’t worry we will return back your paid money.I answered, this is the 1st time on my life someone asks for the ID of receiver not the sender. Then I told him, I am not worried on my MONEY back. I am worried on the 6 days gone, and the way DHL act with no respect of time. And why all time I (the customer) to spent the time to call to find out on status while DHL who is paid a lot of money and their responsibility must call immediately if the shipment NORMAL status have changed to save the valuable time which all customers expect/seeks from DHL. In addition to all, it’s DHL officer mistake who put the receiver two names only not the full four name as per passport. It’s DHL mistake since we have no wrong done and we provided what your officer asks for by providing a copy of receiver passport. Hazem

review-6113923,Verified Reviewer,"If you want a simple delivery from Mexico to the USA use UPS or any other because DHL sucks. I dropped a pack and paid for express delivery and now it is 3 days delayed; and they say it's company's policies (which no one at the offices warned us about when dropping and paying). I think DHL should manage their process and tell in advance when they can't deliver instead of pricing you the Express Service (that is quite expensive) and then let you know that they can't deliver. I've lost all trust and a possible deal, so tell me who's going to refund me that deal worth thousands of dollars.I don't even know if they'll refund the shipping that they were uncapable of delivering correctly. I don't care about policies. If a ""serious"" company like DHL says they'll deliver the next day, it should deliver as agreed. Otherwise, they are liars, rip offs and scammers. So if they tell you next day, be aware it means in 3 days. So you better pay for a normal shipping (it'll be cheaper) or look for another trustworthy company like UPS or FEDEX.

review-6108127,Verified Reviewer,"Controlaccount work on behalf of DHL as a debt collector. I had an invoice from DHL for £996.23 for the importation of two mobility tricycles including a levy for £361:23 which I did not understand what it was for. I thought it was an import tax but a mobility scooter is zero import tax so I thought I would query it with DHL. So I sent them an email and they said not to pay it while they looked into it. Nothing happened then until I got a demanding letter from DHL so in receipt of that I paid the difference between the £996 and the £361 expecting them to come back and ask why, so I got my original question/query answered. DHL drew the money from my bank on the 17th April and I then received the debt collectors Controlaccount demand on the 26th April for the full amount plus debt charges. I then sent a recorded letter (I have signatures for acceptance) to both DHL and Controlaccount outlining my invoice query and asking for an explanation.I have never received a reply to either letter just another demand from Controlaccount for the balance now owing plus charges. I have tried to talk to Controlaccount by email but this is impossible as they only want phone calls so you have no record of what transpires. I sent an email via their own website asking them to email me as I wanted a record and they replied thanking me for asking for a statement of what I owed. I think I have the right to query an invoice (After 45 years in business) if I want to and should have a reply so I can then agree to pay or dispute same.My wife has paid the amount behind my back to get rid of it as I was prepared to go to court with my paperwork,showing that nobody could be bothered to talk to me about an invoice query, just ignore any reasonable request and hound me into the ground. DHL and Controlaccount in my own opinion are acting as dictators and bulldozing customers around. I am surprised that DHL want to get a bad reputation acting this way and using debt collectors that you cannot send an email to. Shame on you both.

I asked her, what about it was incorrect so I may fix the issue. It was vague response after vague response which doesn't help. I tried reaching out to her via telephone but she was never available. DHL took down my phone number to contact me, but Israel responded to me via email saying that they didn't take down my full phone number, and also my shipment was in danger of being sent back to the sender. I tried to contact her via phone again, but she was not available. Really, not such a big deal, people are busy. I spoke to a gentleman (William **) whom was extremely helpful and told me what was finally incorrect about the document. I resubmitted and he confirmed that everything looked good. Then I received another email from Israel telling me that a document was too blurry (she did not specify which document), that my tax ID photo was not one full page (which it was) and that my shipment was going to be sent back to the sender. I responded again my email asking WHICH DOCUMENT?! I called again, and a lady responded by telling me she reviewed the emails I sent and the documents I sent were 'too small' in which I told her to click the document so I can enlarge. Not sure how one person can see them and say they look fine, but be told by another she can't read them. After 6 days of trying to get my shipment, they told me the documents look good once again. And what help was my original contact . . . . none. You can't expect people to know what you're talking about when there are multiple things in play. Be specific so the issue can be handled. I want my stuff, you want the correct documents. No reason to drag it on, be vague, and act like the customer should know everything about how your system works.

review-4962403,Verified Reviewer,"Just today received a box with a gift and an apology from DHL.
Didn’t change the missing package but was thoughtful.The replacement arrived April 2 the day following them turning it over to the Post Office.Original review: April 2, 2019Ordered an item from Estonia and they use DHL and it gets worse from there. According to tracking it was shipped March 14 and arrived in Jacksonville FL on March 18. Estimated to be delivered to St. Augustine by end of day (don’t you love that phrase) March 20. When it didn’t arrive I called DHL customer “service” number and the fun started. First I was told they don’t deliver to my Zip code and would turn it over to the Postal Service for delivery. When I asked if they could hold it in Jacksonville and I would drive up and get it. He said he would call Jax and see. Then he said it wasn’t there and that the tracking location reflected a container scan but my package wasn’t there and he would start an investigation.Two days later I am contacted by the inquiry rep who wanted me to send Hera picture of it so they could search for it. I asked how I could send a picture of something I hadn’t received and referred her to the sender. She next said since I ordered it I must have seen it on a website and should have a picture. I sent her the link to the product website but pointed out that it didn’t show how it would be packed for shipment. The sender, Shark RF, who I copied all these emails to sent me pictures of the shipping packaging which I forwarded to her and asked if she got them. No reply. Late Monday after receiving no promised call I called DHL and demanded to speak to a supervisor. She could not find any pictures but said they would start a search, this being a week after the container arrived in Jacksonville.The next day they contacted me and said it was lost and to notify the shipper to make a claim. I contacted Shark RF and requested a replacement be shipped by an alternate carrier. Lo and behold on March 27 I am notified a replacement is on the way by, you guessed it, DHL. Tracking showed it in Jacksonville on April 1 so I called DHL to see if the Postal delivery was true or BS. They said it was but would hold it in Jacksonville for me and would notify me when the container was unloaded and I could pick it up. About 3:00 PM April 1 I was notified it was “forwarded for delivery.” When fearing the worst I called, APRIL FOOLS, you guessed it. It had been turned over to the Postal Service so I am still waiting for it. What a bunch of moronicilles (morons & imbeciles all rolled into one). I hope that is detailed enough.

Unfortunately, that's where the tracking stayed...not for one, two or even five days. ELEVEN DAYS!!! Here's the worst part...original destination of the package was Kentucky and I live in Michigan! There is only ONE state in between us! I understand that Ohio is awful and nobody likes it, but unless the DHL delivery vehicle was a 10 speed, I'm not sure HOW it takes 11 days to get from Kentucky to Michigan.

I've been having issues with this item so the company she bought the item from sent me a few cheap replacement parts via DHL once again. This time DHL is honoring the signature requirement and given I can't be home at noon on weekdays I simply cannot sign for this package to receive it. Secondly, because my girlfriend ordered the item and lives hundreds of miles away, I cannot pick up the item in person either. Finally, DHL claims there has been no signature release despite the company I ordered the package from confirming that DHL received and acknowledged the signature release.

review-4613842,Verified Reviewer,"I have been trying to use DHL eCommerce Packet & Packet Plus to ship to customers internationally for over 1 year now. On signup I was advised shipping would take around 3 weeks to most countries, and I would be provided tracking information when Packet Plus was used by paying additional money for. Reality has been that about: 30% of parcels have been lost with no explanation. 90% of parcels have actually taken 4-8 weeks for delivery. To lodge an enquiry I have to complete an excel doc with 26 rows of information required. Enquiries into missing parcels then take up to 1 month to investigate.The service is absolutely pathetic. What customer in their right mind is going to accept that after their parcel has not been delivered within the estimated time frame of 3 weeks, I now need them to allow a month for the investigation?? This has resulted in me providing many refunds in most instances because I know DHL won't magically find all the parcels they have lost, nor can I expect a (rightfully so) disgruntled customer to wait 1 month for the outcome.

Of course no one has an answer. I originally set the delivery address to my office so my wife would not see the package prior to Christmas so it was a surprise. That ship has sailed. On 12/21/2018 received text message that delivery will be attempted that day. I looked up on website using their waybill #. Said by end of business for the day. I called to ask when expected and if could be narrowed down to smaller time window because I had an emergency that came up with close friend 45 minutes away. 1st rep I spoke to stated they don't have way to communicate with drivers and they do not have GPS on drivers. COMPLETE LIE. I told her that is impossible and would be legal liability for company. She then stated that only dispatch can reach drivers. Asked to be forwarded to them or given their contact information. Told me she can't give that information. Asked to speak to supervisor. She put me on hold for 20 minutes. She never came back and call was terminated suddenly. Called back and was on hold for 20 minutes to just speak to rep. Call just terminated out of nowhere. 3rd time spoke to guy that told me they can communicate with drivers after I told him my situation and my previous experiences and displeasure. Informed me that package would be delivered NO SOONER than 4pm est and latest 615pm est. It was around 1pm at this time. Told him I had stop to make that will take me 30 minutes or less 10 minutes away from my office and then would be back there after that and will put piece of cardboard into main door to the building and driver can place package there and remove cardboard and door will automatically lock. Rep said that this arrangement will work and driver has been made aware fully. I went to my stop. Completed my task and then check my phone to see notification there was attempt to deliver package at 135 pm est! I called back and asked how this happened when I was told rep was speaking with driver and that no possible way there before 4pm.

Have family affairs going on later in the day and just looking to get better time window of when package would be delivered to my office because I will not be there today office closed for the day. But informed live 10 minutes away and if possible that driver could contact me when close to being there. Can meet him/her there and receive package if it is prior to 230 pm est because would be leaving area at that time for family Christmas plans. He informed me that I should be receiving call from driver. Told him was told the same about supervisor calling me. Said that if I don't receive call then to email him to have address changed to my house where my spouse is always available. Never heard from driver. Package attempted to be delivered at my office around 130 pm est again. Sent email to Carlos to have package updated to be delivered to my house. He verified that received email and updated mailing address. 12/27/2018 comes still yet to receive any notification about package. Then check website shows address updated on 12/24/2018 and that's it. Call company again. Was informed after long waiting on hold and explaining situation that my package would be delivered on 12/28/2018. Now today 12/28/2018 still have not received any notification about delivery from company. Now have been on the phone for 43 minutes and they have no idea where my package is. Very obvious this company does not care about customer service or satisfaction in any fashion. Only concerned getting their money from their clients for their service. If possible in any way use any other service (USPS, FedEx, UPS) than this company. You may never get your package.

The item made it from UK to Canada in a few days however it seems that they had lost the package at the gateway on Dec 16. Several calls were made and several promises that the item would be delivered by the 24th. I called DHL on the 24th 3 times and the first two times there were assurances that the package is on a delivery truck. At the end of the business day I decided to follow up only to be told that they don't know where the package is.I phoned DHL today (27th) and was told that they don't have any idea where the package is and that someone would call me. Upon checking the tracking number a few hours later it stated that the parcel is now on a delivery truck. It is now 8pm and still no package. Overall the customer service support doesn't even care, nor did they really try to resolve any issues. I am astonished that DHL can run a business this way.

How is your day today in sunny Brampton, Ontario, Canada and/or wherever else you are in the world? My day is going fine, thank you, except due to the fact that I have been more than patiently waiting for my HSBC credit to arrive for the past two (2) months since it was a replacement from my previous one and because of your stupid driver's inconsideration, ignorance, lack of education, negligence and common sense, I am still not in receipt of it!Yes, your driver falsely made the attempt to deliver the card both back on Friday, December 21, 2018 and earlier today back on Monday, December 24, 2018, however, your extremely stupid driver refused to use his brain to bother reading the name board downstairs so that he could properly get himself buzzed right in. Instead, your damn, idiotic, stupid driver (who was probably drunk or on drugs, who knows these days?) left both door tags on the front glass door in the lobby of my mother's building! How ** and pathetic is that! The loser driver had the correct address and correct phone number right in front of his eyes but could not and/or would not I should say bother to just read the board which was in clear, pure, basic English and just locate the last name of shore and if he did that which is ""Grade one (1) education"", then we would not be in this predicament!Please note: I did call your horrible and horrific customer no service department already just to waste more time and here the lovely excuse that the security code was not written on the door tag, nor given to the driver and of course, they could not redeliver the product back to me on the very same day because, of course, all of the drivers have gone home for the holidays!My response: Once again, your stupid driver had the opportunity to look up my last name and get the buzzard security code and did not care about his job and never bothered, obviously pissing me off tremendously! My personal recommendation: fire him! I know nothing will happen to him because DHL protects all of their workers! Regardless, I have been more than inconvenienced by your loser, low life driver in more ways than one!I have lost many valuable rewards points from not having the card and I can not have use of my card to buy Christmas presents and will therefore have to make several withdrawals from my bank account and even get charged fees since my account only allows one (1) withdrawal per month!

review-4465927,Verified Reviewer,"Looking through the reviews, I'm not at all surprised at the experience I had. Same story as everyone else. I ordered a jacket via Amazon (which is a terrible company in their handling of logistics as well) two weeks ago and expected a modest delivery date by Wednesday, Dec. 19th. According to their website, it was delivered, however I can say unequivocally that it did not arrive. So like any normal person, I contacted their customer support, which answered promptly and seemed to understand that there was an issue. HOWEVER, each day since Wednesday I've received an email from their support saying ""we're still reviewing and will have more to report by tomorrow end of day"". It's been the same story three times now. What the hell are they researching? It's not rocket science-your driver either 1.) delivered it to the wrong address, in which case you either retrieve the package or let the original shipper know of the mishap, or 2.) just lost the package. Either way, doesn't bode very well for you as a shipping company, but EVEN WORSE the fact that you give customers the runaround.I'm now going to dedicate myself to getting the word out on how bad and illegitimate of a company this is. I'm going to push for every major boycott I can. Each time I get something shipped, I will only purchase from a merchant that does not use DHL. I urge everyone else reading these reviews, there's much better shipping companies out there. This type of business cannot be tolerated.

DHL Failed to deliver in the time period I requested on their website & weren't even close to the time. DHL also never left a tracking tag to show they even attended my house on the second attempt. After reading some other reviews I suspect that it is quite possible that they did not attend as the drivers know to leave the tag. Reaching a human is a near impossible mission but when I did, I got someone on training being trained by a moron who lied, putting me on hold for 20 min while I waited to speak to a supervisor. Once the trainee came back on line, the trainee said ""everyone was too busy"". I could hear the person in the background and asked the trainee if this was a supervisor & when she said, 'yes', retracted when I said the one too busy to speak with me after a 20 min hold??Today I waited at home all day for the 2nd package, & then as I'm sitting in my home I receive a text saying ""we attempted to deliver... No one home""!! They didn't even ring the buzzer (which I tested & it does work!). These drivers are lazy, incompetent & have no business in their chosen field. If they can't attend a home & leave a notice, or ring a buzz code as you would a doorbell... Get out of the job & give it to someone who can do these simple tasks. Customer service is brutal.

review-4458256,Verified Reviewer,"December 21, 2018 - end of day comes and I still keep checking my front door but no package. I should have learned from my first experience with you, DHL, from back in October 2018. Just like back in October 2019, this evening I received an email “ Sorry we missed you”... There were 3 Adults and 2 children in the house. No DHL ringing this bell today. All of us heard UPS and USPS ringing our bell throughout the day today but guess what? None of us heard your driver, DHL! Now how is that possible? Me and countless customers will tell you how: your driver never makes the rounds, but heck forget that for a moment! I even wonder if your company even releases the packages to the customers?! This looks to me more and more like a fictional courier-platform! So after I receive the email this evening, telling me the driver missed us, I go again outside my front door to discover no “we missed you” note on my door. I kept checking my front door all day knowing that I placed the order with strict instructions “release package at front door” and even this process spent more of my time online to do but I did it just to make sure I receive my package on time. I called customer service immediately. The lady seems like a cheery voice who’s about to make your day better by hopefully placing you on hold so they can contact the driver. But just like other reviewers here, I’m being told they can’t contact driver. Instead she tells me that the driver put a note in the system stating that “they don’t have the code for my front door”. What code? First of all - as the DHL customer, am I supposed to share my front door entrance code, if any applicable, with the driver? Secondly, there is no code! It’s a buzzer. A $5.00 that can show you only 3 buttons 1, 2, & 3 for the 3 floors of this house... I tell her the same things I write here. She then goes to tell me “for your area we have the DHL office in Long Island and the work from 8am-6pm on Friday and...” That’s when I understood, that convinced me! I am not only being duped by the driver but now this lady on the phone is playing around too! I continue to tell her that I would like my package tomorrow, Saturday, if tonight is not possible. She continues to repeat that she will place an urgent note on this and that I should get my package on the Christmas Eve. And that unfortunately they work Monday to Friday.I am a full-time employee and a hard working mother, nothing comes to me for free and I am absolutely positive I wouldn’t get the satisfaction from enjoying something that came for free! Now I ask you Dear DHL CEO, Dear DHL investors - are you all ok with what is going on within this company? Are you all ok and sleep good at night knowing you duped millions of people of millions of dollars by selling up fake products your company either can’t live up to it or, most likely knows they’re a scam all to ensure your stocks are rolling? Are you even reading your clients’ reviews on your products?If your company bets on nice customers like who don’t say anything the first time they are tricked (like myself back in October 2019) but go through the same experience the 2nd time, what does that make you? I am not here to call names and play games... I want to look at fairness for all. Me, the client, paid you DHL for a product, express shipping... What do you, DHL, do to ensure you stand by your product?! Nothing! Absolutely nothing... You pocket my money and million others’ and you enjoy the fame of International Courier company.I am utterly disappointed in the way you, DHL, make business.

review-4410163,Verified Reviewer,"Summary: DO NOT EVER USE DHL FOR ANYTHING. If a company ships with DHL then order from another company, it is not worth the stress and hassle. I ordered a package that shipped from another country, and was handed over to DHL upon arrival in Canada. Through a 2 week-long ordeal trying to get a package delivered, staying home all day so that I could receive it, and repeatedly seeing the message 'delivery attempted, no one home,' even though I was home and received no knocks on the door, or saw anyone outside, my first step was to call customer service. I had to call 3 times to correct the address on file and add my phone number over and over again. Each time I got through and passed along the information I was told it would be delivered the next day, and each day I received the message 'delivery attempted, no one home' and then when I called, customer service once again did not have my address on file. I eventually had enough and arranged to pick up the package at their service point (their office). The person at the front desk wasn't able to access any information about the package and had no clue where it was.The underlying issue is that DHL employees do not communicate together and are limited in what they can access. They lie to you and tell you they can see a complete system but in reality, they only have access to their little portion of the system. What you tell one person is not communicated to another department and they operate on different computer systems. Their customer service center is a call center in India.Eventually, the employee at the front desk of their service point gave me the phone number of a supervisor, a local boss who seems to be the only person able to communicate any information to a driver, or access the entire computer system. He sorted it out for me surprisingly quickly but at DHL they often refuse to let you speak to anyone in management. It took 2 weeks once it was out for delivery before I eventually received the package. If your package is being shipped with DHL, I recommend calling customer service or going to one of their service point locations, getting the name and number of a 'boss' as they call them at DHL, and calling them directly. Otherwise there is no guarantee anything they say to you on the phone is true.

review-4406647,Verified Reviewer,"A document was mailed from Hong Kong on Nov 26, 2018 using DHL service. We had been home and waited for this package. After 10 days, the sender from Hong Kong emailed us said our gate was locked, driver could not get inside. We provided the intercom and telephone numbers to the sender. During the week, I followed up with the DHL call center a few times and agents did different things. The package was delivered 2nd time after 13 days. When the driver buzzed at the entrance, we opened the door and watch the lobby through our TV. The driver did not come inside, instead he left the building. The call center helped us to contact the supervisor and asked the driver to redeliver. The driver said he could not go back and would leave the package in the nearest service point for pick up. The package was picked up on Dec 8. It took 2 weeks using DHL. We paid so much and did not get any service at all. It was absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous.On his first visit, the driver could buzz the manager intercom which is displayed on the screen. She would open the door for him. On his 2nd delivery, we opened the door from our unit and he did not come up to deliver the package. He did not know he was being watched through the camera. Did he know he has to deliver the package to our unit? Did he know his responsibility? He was just lazy and did not do his job at all. He wrote false reason on line why the package was not delivered. This driver should be fired. If we have to make a trip to pick up the package, why should we use DHL? The driver just ruining DHL reputation and wasting customer’s money and time. How can DHL compensate our loss of time due to the unnecessary delay?

review-4388623,Verified Reviewer,"DHL is INCOMPETENT, FRAUDULENT and INDIFFERENT. We had the displeasure of paying for services to DHL in Europe, where I was sending humanitarian educational assistance to persecuted students under Russian occupation. A portion of the Moldovan territory. i.e. Transnistria, is occupied by the 14th Russian Army, which among other atrocities, since 1991, stops Romanian students in that area to have access to books and other educational materials in their native language. When our parcel was sent via DHL from Romania to Moldova, DHL Romania charged the sender and stated that NO money was to be paid by the receiver. HOWEVER, when DHL Moldova received the parcel, it kidnapped it and refused to release the books until illegal and fraudulent taxes were to be paid by the receiver. This is a breach of contract between DHL and us, the client, who paid the fees for taxes under a different understanding.After I contacted the Logistics office of DHL, the response I received was this: “according to the system, it is detained in customs because some paperwork is being required, please also note that there is no record of duties pending of payment.” Please see the complete text at the bottom. The receiver therefore, refused to pay these fraudulent taxes and the books will be returned to Romania. This DHL action, of soliciting money against the company’s OWN policy and inquiry results, is a clear demonstration that DHL is INCOMPETENT, FRAUDULENT and INDIFFERENT. Yet our request to have the fraudulent DHL staff from Moldova be fired remained on deaf ears, as it was our request for refunding the charges we were taxed for the parcel for the Romania-Moldova transportation.We will never, ever use DHL and I’m encouraging everybody to use a different courier service, with a better track of professional service, delivery and lack of fraudulent charges. Official response: “I am deeply sorry for the delay on the follow up of your case. I tracked your shipment and according to the system, it is detained in customs because some paperwork is being required, please also note that there is no record of duties pending of payment. Unfortunately, from the US, I am unable to start an investigation, please contact DHL Romania at 021 222 1 777 or ** so we can start an investigation and assist you to solve this.

I waited for another entire day as no updates was available on the DHL website which means that the item hasn't arrived at the service point yet. I was close to the brink of sanity now and called at night again, had this very competent and empathetic gentleman handwritten a request for redelivery! He told me that the requests sent the night before and this morning didn't go through and the package was laying in the gateway (Montreal airport) for the entire day collecting dust!This morning finally I got a update saying that my package is ready for pickup at their downtown service point, 2 days later than the original delivery and after countless call /effort for my part! Two things frustrated me the most with DHL was their employees' attitudes, very defensive and cold! Blaming me for not leaving a buzzer code (it's literally my apartment number 6!) and arguing that leaving a notice is not a common practice when package couldn't be delivered, what??? Then how people would know that there was a attempted delivery? Anyways, won't buy anything that is going to be delivered by DHL again!!! Please do the same to save you from a lot of time being a home prisoner and headache dealing with their incompetent and cold representatives! (Though one was super nice and efficient, a rarely found quality at DHL I guess!)

It had updated that the package was received and had been on ""en route"" to destination (NY, USA to ON, Canada). I was pleased at the time, until that was literally the only update that was ever given. Not even a date change since Oct. 25, until 2 weeks ago when on Nov. 04, it stated the following ""We wish to inform you that a number of packages may experience delayed or missing tracking information. Continue to check this tracking page for the latest update. Please accept our sincere apology for any inconvenience this may cause."" It has been 2 weeks! I have called 5 times and still am told to simply wait and given the run about of excuses. It's extremely frustrating to not even be told as to why they have lost my tracking information, where is the driver with my package or where did they last track it to? They would not tell me, just ""wait for more information"". Thankfully I have also contacted the original sender site, whom are extremely reliable about service and they checked with DHL and got back to me that they too were unable to confirm tracking with them as well, and due to this unreasonable delay in delivery via DHL kindly refunded my full purchase and offered to send the items again free of charge for this issue of delivery choice. I simply stated until DHL is fixed it would be a waste of time and money on both our parts to continue to be involved for now. If I ever due receive my package, I will attempt to follow up here for the sake of other recipients using DHL delivery services for items. (I neglect to state the name of the original sender company as much as I would love to promote their amazing service, it is for their well being that they are not involved in this negative post in regards to my experience strictly with DHL).

review-4276939,Verified Reviewer,"I ordered a Mac mini from Apple on launch day. Everything went smoothly on their end, until DHL showed up (or rather didn’t). The original delivery date was for 9 November 2018. Plenty of time to give notice to my employer and request the day off. On 6th November, I received a text from DHL saying my delivery will be due on 8th November. Since my line of work doesn’t allow me to check my phone during the day (food processing), I didn’t see that until I left work. No way I can swap my days off again, so I went on to the delivery tracker to leave specific instructions where to leave the parcel. Their website specifically mentioned that signature is not required so I can ask for the package to be left with a neighbor or in a safe place.My dad works in a hotel just 30 seconds walk from my house. It’s actually easier for the delivery driver to go there anyway since my house is behind said hotel without vehicle access. 8th November comes. Funny enough, we finished all orders and left work way early at noon. I was at home by half past 12. No delivery yet. My dad keeps checking on reception regularly, super nice of him to do so. 4pm, still nothing. 6pm, nothing. Online tracking is not updated, so I leave a message on the DHL website to not take it to the hotel the next day, but take it to the original address. I received confirmation of said change.I wake up at 7 am on 9th November (mind that this was the original promised date) to the tracking telling me the delivery was refused, returning to sender. Excuse me?! I received no message, no email, no phone call, no calling card through the letter box saying “we missed you”, nothing. I jump out of the bed and call Apple straight away. Lady is super helpful, even goes out of her way to try and contact DHL to turn around and deliver my parcel ASAP. She hit every wall possible along the way, couldn’t even contact DHL.I call my bank, asking about what happens with the finance if I cancel the order and go to a store in person and re-apply. This would take 48 hours to clear before I can be approved again. I look at every possible hole to find contact details or customer helpline for DHL and tell them I am home, I’m waiting (and possible scream at them for being sneaky and not even have the decency to lie into my face. Refused delivery? Can’t they read?)I call Apple again, and we spend the most helpful half an hour talking to find a solution. DHL acting like they don’t even exist. Impossible to get hold of them. Apple guy launches an official investigation and promises to get my Mac delivered with priority shipping (I love this guy!!!) while DHL’s system lie into his face as well saying they tried twice (Uhm, no they didn’t. For once, I was lucky to arrive home early. I even asked my neighbors and they didn’t see anyone with a DHL van, nor any delivery looking person walk down the alley to the tow of houses behind the hotel mentioned above).DHL left no notice, no calling card, no text, no email, nothing to even give me a chance to re-schedule or pick my parcel up from a depot (I could have gone to Inverness and save them the trouble, but no way). DHL has no customer service, and at this point, this being far from the first time they do exactly the same thing, I will never, ever use their services again. I’m making sure that if I’m the future I order something online, contact the seller to make sure they won’t use DHL.All this, and here I am, on the evening on the day my parcel was originally promised for, and I am without my order. More so, I’ll have to take yet another day off from work next week and just hope they will deliver. On the bright side, though, Apple told me if the worst comes to worse, they will honour the finance and reserve a Mac mini for me in a store I choose. I’m definitely avoiding DHL in the future, however.

Their website for online payment of the fees in order to have the package left at the door without signature was also insecure and my browser warned me attackers could potentially be trying to steal my information if I paid online.

After the 15th call and 9th voice mail, I decided to answer the 16th call and inform the representative that they have the wrong phone number on the file. The representative apologized for the mix up and noted the file.The very next day, I got three additional calls from DHL wanting to schedule the delivery. When I took the fourth call and explained the situation to the agent he got very upset, accused me of lying, and that I will accept delivery today. I immediately hung up the phone and blocked the number. To my surprise, he called right back on another line, and demanded that I schedule the delivery or, and I quote, ""I will come to your apartment and kick the ** out of you!"" I have now contacted the local authorities to investigate this matter and filed complaints with Consumer Affairs and the BBB. Needless to say, DHL needs to get their business practices in order, and stop harassing people - especially people who are not responsible for their mess.

review-4148522,Verified Reviewer,"Shoutout POLISH DHL office, I'm going to sue them. THEY LOST MY PASSPORT AND I MISSED THE FLIGHT AND LOST 2000$ TICKETS! I ordered ""Saturday delivery package"" to pick up my passport from the embassy in Warsaw in Friday and deliver it to Krakow on Saturday. I called twice before the day of delivery to customer service to provide all details and to be sure that the courier has all needed information. They convinced me that everything is ok and courier has all info and my passport will be on time. On Friday I got the email saying my passport has been taken from the embassy. On Saturday morning I called the customer service and they said my passport is still is in embassy. Later they found that the courier created a new order with Standard delivery instead of Saturday delivery and THEY EVEN DIDN'T NOTIFY ME THAT MY ORDER WAS CANCELLED. The whole Saturday I was trying to find my passport and was calling the customer service. I took the train and went to Warsaw. BUT NOBODY EVEN WAS TRYING TO FIND MY PASSPORT! When I arrived to Warsaw they said my parcel is already in Krakow, but nobody is going to give it to me because it's not Saturday package.Thanks God, I got my passport on Monday evening, and the cost of the delivery was for Saturday package. So they forgot about Saturday delivery package, but they didn't forget to charge me for that. Of course nobody answered me about my complaints. I can be sure this company doesn't care about anything: not about the service they should provide, not about customer relationship, not even about their reputation. It's my mistake too, I shouldn't trust such important document to any third party company and should to pick up the document by myself. And I should read reviews about them before, nobody trust them. I'm just wondering how they got license and can't do such simple job.

The address is clearly on the package, no one asked me to give them the telephone number of the recipient when I shipped it and if they need it, DHL could have contacted the branch where it was originally sent for shipment so they can ask me about the phone number of the recipient. On top of this, I complaint via telephone and I was told someone is going to contact me but it's over a week now and nobody contacted me by phone. I also wrote a complaint on their website and again, no one dared to contact me.I contracted DHL to DELIVER my documents but instead, it was PICKED UP because they are so irresponsible with handling their customers.

review-3828937,Verified Reviewer,"Blown away at how awful this company is. I ordered an expensive lens from Brussels about three weeks ago. It was delivered by BPost and arrived in the states in less than a week. BPost works with DHL directly, but the incredibly rude and condescending woman I dealt with at DHL blamed USPS (surprise surprise). She told me DHL doesn't work with BPost and that I ""need to be more proactive, learn how to use google, and to stop wasting her time."" She literally said all of that verbatim. It took me everything I had to hang up on her without screaming at first. So here we are. The lens has been sitting at DHL since July 4th.According to the tracking information, they contacted me on July 4th about a payment and since I was unable to be reached, the lens is being retained at their distribution center. Well, I was home until 7pm that day so that's clearly a lie. No phone call, no email, no text, no notice in the mail. Plus, I'm pretty sure DHL is closed on the 4th of July? The tracking information BPost supplied me with is also a USPS tracking number and for that reason DHL denies any involvement with this whatsoever. GUESS WHAT? THE PACKAGE HAS TO GO THROUGH DHL BEFORE GETTING TO USPS! How is it that I know more about this sorry excuse for a company than the people who work there? According to USPS tracking, the label has been created but is not yet in their system.Again, this means DHL hasn't signed off. I had the seller contact BPost again yesterday, and they confirmed that DHL (4 miles from my house) has the package in their possession. So since they won't let me pay the import duties and deny up and down any involvement with this whatsoever, I guess I'll just give up photography for a however many months it takes to (hopefully) get reimbursed since I don't and will never have another $3,000 floating around for a replacement. Never again. Ever. Under no circumstance. Thanks for nothing you greasy, lying, parasitic cheats.

review-3803101,Verified Reviewer,"DHL has a very poor website layout. The website does not split the creation of a shipment information into several steps. Instead it is one long huge web form that has to be filled out over and over again. No intermediate savings points. Address book creation takes place only after payment. It took me about 4 attempts and probably an hour to get almost everything right. Then they require shippers to lie on the recipient address (possibly to Customs!).They require a 'Company Name' even though the recipient is private. I put in 'N/A'. The label now says N/A for recipient name!!! One can only see the result AFTER payment!!! Customs information is equally confusing instead of using standard intuitive click through menus, they have text embedded links which are red instead of blue. Completely counter intuitive!!!

Today it did not arrive, so I called customer service again, and the man did not know where my package was when it clearly stated that it was on hold in OKC.

I told him that it was a textbook for a class I am taking, and I already had a quiz due, and another one coming up in 2 days. He told me there was nothing more he could do. I told him I wanted to speak to a manager. He got very upset with me, and he scolded me on the phone like I was a child. I could not believe that he actually scolded me. I have done customer service jobs for many years, and I cannot imagine talking to a customer the way he spoke to me. I stopped talking, and he got more upset and ranted for a bit, then put me on hold and transferred me to another person. She was able to tell me that my package was in OKC. I asked her why the man could not, and she said he should have been able to. I told her I was scolded by him, and she said a manager will review the recorded call. She asked for my address, email, and phone number, and I told her everything I told the woman on Monday. She said the information in the computer was not updated with my correct information from Monday's conversation with the other woman. I was told that they will ship my package tomorrow.

I was informed I could pick up my package on Monday, which was a holiday, assumed the service center might still be open, and was disappointed to find that it wasn't. The next day, my boyfriend went to pick up the package and was met with nothing but rudeness from the clerk. The clerk literally opened the door and ushered him out with his arms when he didn't have a signed note - generally he felt like he was being talked down to like a criminal or an idiot.This was in spite of being listed as a recipient, this was in spite of having his phone number on the package, in spite of him having the text from DHL. While inside, there was another lady complaining to the same employee. The employee cut the lady off in order to deal with my boyfriend. Both my boyfriend and I work full time jobs which makes it very difficult to even show up at a service point 3 days in a row (especially given the operating hours).For the reference, this was at the Richmond street location in downtown Toronto on May 21st, 22nd, and 23rd.

I just would like to share my worst experience about the missing parcel, and don't want anyone to be victim in this situation like me. Last couple months, my roommate recommended me about Superdry online. Then, we both have placed the online order separately from Superdry for the first time. The website mentioned that delivery was express, and we got it on time for the first order (express delivery should be less than three days). Later, I have placed two more orders continuously. The status of second order showed ""It was delivered"" in the fifth day since the day I placed the order, but unfortunately I did not receive this second parcel. On that day, I got the message in the early morning asking about signature requirement, and I did say ""No"" as usual because my roommate and I were very sure to be able to take it on time, and the parcel should be delivered in shortly since the message was sent out. We kept checking all day long until the last message said ""it was delivered"" in evening time, and we still did not see any parcel in our building. At that time, I thought the delivery might be delayed and came at the same time with the third parcel. A day later, I got only the third parcel, and still couldn't find the second one. Finally, I decided to call Superdry's customer service, and the answer that I got was I had to contact DHL express by myself. I kept calling DHL to find my parcel, therefore, he came in my building and said that he left my parcel inside the building by using password to unlock the door. I asked him back, ""If you left it here, we should see it."" The building's security camera is not working, and of course you can say ""you left it here"". The day after, I called DHL again, and the answer was ""your neighbor might take it, you should ask them"". You know what, in our building, so many parcels were left there over nights, but still not missing. I kept calling DHL express and Superdry's customer service for almost two weeks, but it still could not help anything. Eventually, I sent the message via Superdry website about the missing parcel, and the answer that I got is ""the liability for the parcel shifts from the courier to yourself due to no signature require"". I'm done with Superdry after I saw this email. If I don't really want those stuffs, I won't waste my time calling you and DHL for almost two weeks.I know you want to protect your benefit, but please understand customer's side. Your policy does not support customers. You should remind the customers about the liability without signature requirement before you ship the products out, not just asking Yes or No. Please work as professional as others do, for example, Amazon Prime, Sephora, Kiehl's, Zara, The North Face, Adidas, Neiman Marcus, etc. They don't even need to ask about signature, but their parcel were delivered completely.

I was checking the tracking every 10-15 minutes, the moment I refreshed the tracking info again, I see a ""delivery attempted"". I live in a one way street, there is no other way around my house. I was sitting outside waiting for the DHL van to drop off my package, they NEVER SHOWED UP. I can see from outside who comes and who doesn't, because it is a WAY ONE street. There is no other way around the house. I called DHL three times, did they fix the problem for me as always. I asked to talked to the manager, his name was Wayne ** (in Arizona), he was NO help at all. He said that if the driver knew the zone and he knew about my apartment that needed a gate code he automatically will marked DELIVERY ATTEMPTED, can you guys believe this???? I told him, that I waited the whole day and night for this package, and that driver didn't make it to the house. THE MANAGER DIDNT GIVE A ** ABOUT IT, DHL ARE A PIECE OF **.

You can imagine my intense frustration at this point. Why am I the one spending all this time trying to hunt down my own package? None of the representatives try to do anything to locate the package except look up the tracking number - thanks I can do that myself. Can't they send a request for someone to locate it in the warehouse like other companies do? DHL assumed no responsibility and told me to contact the merchant I bought the items from. Even if I get a refund, most of the items I bought are now out of stock and I will not be able to get them. I want my package. I don't understand how a package can just disappear and how a shipping company can do nothing to try and locate it. This company is awful and I will never ever use it again.

review-3475594,Verified Reviewer,"I’ve been using DHL eCommerce (used to be DHL GlobalMail) to ship around 50 shipments in the past few months for my phone case business (kulorcases.com). So unlike most reviews here regarding individual lost or delayed shipments, I’m here to provide a more holistic review on Aramex (note: I’m also using Aramex, EMS, Airmail, UPS, FedEx, etc.).Delivery Performance. My business is HongKong based and we used DHL eCommerce to ship to SE Asia, Europe and the US. The committed transit time is around 7-17 working days for most of the regions mentioned above. And out of the 50+ shipments, I would say 20% were delivered on time, 50% were delivered late or delayed and 10%(!) were lost. As a benchmark, Postal Airmail has lost around 3-5% of my shipments, Aramex has lost ~1% of my shipments and UPS/FedEx has lost none.Most delayed items were routed via their Frankfurt hub. For example, items that were shipped from HK to Australia, US, Taiwan, Singapore were all mindbogglingly routed via Frankfurt. And given the time required for them to ship to the destination countries and then pass to the local postal service for the final leg local deliveries, it usually takes much longer time for them than their committed transit times. However, items shipped to Europe are usually delivered on time and faster than HK Post Airmail. Cost. Their shipping costs are around 10-50% higher than HK Post's Airmail/e-Express (e.g. ~HK$40 vs $23.8 to the US) and about 1/2 to 1/5 of prices of tier 1 couriers like UPS and FedEx (for 0.15kg anyway). Airmail typically takes 7-14 working days to deliver, UPS takes 2-3 days to deliver.Service/Support. I find their tracking to be worse than postal service. Even though their selling point to us merchants is that they provide ""end-to-end"" tracking, the reality is that, for a number of main markets, it only tracks the items until the point where they are supposed to hand over the items to the local postal service. So most of the time, the tracking of the shipped items work great in the initial phase of the shipment, but it sadly tailed off towards the end, which is really not much use to me and my clients.In terms of their support and delivery staff’s professionalism, it’s the worst shipping company I have ever dealt with. I have asked them to help me integrate their APIs to our shipping software. After a few rounds of initial discussions, their ""integration manager"" simply told me that our volume does not warrant such integration and simply asked me to use their excel spreadsheet to upload my orders manually. (Note: they have recently released an app to integrate to my Shopify backend but it was buggy as hell.)Moreover, given the 10% shipment lost rate (and many angry emails from my customers), I had plenty of chances to deal with their DHL eCommerce's support. Every time they simply provided me with a) either tracking information that I could easily find on my portal, or b) a canned response telling me to ask the receiver of the shipment to seek help from the local postal service.Bottom line: DHL eCommerce (which is different from the tier 1 courier DHL Express) is only an airmail/postal service in DHL's disguise. The DHL brand does help give my customers some confidence but their service is really terrible in terms of transit speed and shipment lost rate. And the fact that their services actually cost more than the HK Post's airmail/e-Express services, I would suggest to anyone considering to use DHL eCommerce to avoid this company.

review-3471952,Verified Reviewer,"I have had a nasty experience with DHL. I don't even know why they have a Dept called customer service. I had a package shipped to me from the United States. The shipper had shipped other items to me before using same address and telephone number and DHL. For some reason DHL failed to deliver or contact me that I had a package. The package was returned to US and I only found out after I enquired from the shipper. Unfortunately the shipper did not avail a tracking number. When I approached DHL the excuse I was given was the dumbest ever. I was told the shipment did not have a delivery address or phone. Question is how was the airway bill generated without vital data? In any case that shipment has been reshipped. DHL tell me they cannot assist without the tracking number.

review-3465796,Verified Reviewer,"I ordered a package and it had a delivery date of Thursday 3/22/18 and required a signature for delivery. I sat home all day long for the package and decided to call DHL at 2pm to track my package since I had been home all day waiting. They told me it left early that morning and it should have been there so give it a few more minutes or so. At 4pm, I decided to run to the store since I wasted the whole day waiting on this package. At 4:15 I received a phone call from the carrier asking directions to my apartment. It's a carrier service. You should have directions to my address before you even leave your office! Not only did they need directions, they didn't even have my apartment number though my tracking shows my apartment number on the address.I told the carrier that I just stepped out but was 5 minutes away. They told me they couldn't wait 5 minutes though I waited all day for them. They told me they'll take it to the leasing office and I told them the office doesn't accept packages anymore. So I rescheduled for the next day Friday 3/23/2018. The carrier put in the request to deliver the next day but confirmed delivery time was unknown. I literally stayed home all day Friday from sunrise to sunset waiting on my package.I called DHL Saturday morning 3/23/2018 and complained to the representative that I had to use up two days to sit at home waiting for a package that I have yet to receive. The rep told me that I refused the package and would have to drive an hour from Norcross, GA to Forest Park, GA to pick my package up. I told the rep that this makes no sense as I would not refuse my own package. I went on to tell the rep that I spoke with the carrier and confirmed I wasn't home and I wanted a rescheduled delivery.With an ugly attitude, the rep went on to tell me someone at my house refused it. I live alone and there was no one at my house to refuse. She then said that the carrier went to the leasing office and they refused my package. I told the carrier that the leasing office doesn't accept packages so why would they go to the leasing office anyway? She said it was standard procedure. I then asked, why did the carrier agree to reschedule if it was going to be put in as a refusal and I'd be forced to deliver my own package to myself? She says she has no proof of the carrier rescheduling. I quickly informed her that the rescheduling and confirmation was through text message and I have all that proof. She said,""Oh, well I can call the office and ask if they can re-delivery some time next week but more than likely you will have to go pick it up since you refused the package.""So though I have proof of rescheduling, which would be proof that I didn't refuse, I would still more than likely have to go deliver my own package to myself though I paid for delivery? I'm obviously in the wrong because of the crap their carrier pulled and the customer service didn't want to help correct their mistake. Never again will I use DHL for any kind of delivery service. Poor delivery services and even worst customer service help! Avoid DHL at all costs!

Luckily I know the laws in the Philippines and I know how much can be charged and I knew this was bogus and refused to pay.

review-3320449,Verified Reviewer,"A few weeks ago I mailed a parcel internationally. Unfortunately it was the worst experience I've ever had. The parcel was a few bottles of fish oil to my parents, worth about $300 CAD. I asked every detail about DHL international mailing, and attached the copy of receipt and paid for the extra insurance fee they asked me to. I even double checked if the customs need anything else, and the DHL representative told me everything was good to go. I paid $230 CAD DHL's service. However, the customs returned the parcel back to me weeks later because there is a certain value limit (which the DHL representative did NOT tell me at all). And then, DHL charged me another $32 CAD for shipping it back to me - I couldn't even select the option of paying extra customs tax - it had to be returned and paid again.I'm extremely disappointed about the service. I was charged twice, and wasted about a month, for nothing finally. When I worked with DHL before the parcel was sent, I asked particularly in detail to make sure about there wouldn't be any price limit and stuff I should be careful about, did everything he told me to do, paid every price, and got the firm YES answer about this shipping. If I was told by DHL representatives that the customs might return it for that reason, I would not taking the risk mailing it, nor paying the prices, nor wasting the 4-week time.The nutrition product (fish oil) is not restricted by the customs because I was sure other people successfully mailed it using other courier services. The reason they said was the value of total price exceeded an limit ($300 does not sound high either; and it was for my own family and I attached the receipt). Anyway, my point is: whichever the reason was, as a well known courier service professional for a long time trusted by many customers, DHL should have let me know - at least informed me with the possible results that might happen, and let myself decide, instead of saying, ""Yes don't worry,"" and taking my money (then again, for returning). If that, I could make another decision like bringing it back myself to my parents when I travel to visit them.If I was provided with the correct information of a least the possibilities, I would definitely not pay the high price and take the risk ($230 shipping + insurance fee + $32 returning). Because it was my first time doing it internationally with DHL, I even double checked every detail very very carefully to make sure - and they told me it's all good. If you don't know about your business, and think it's the customers' responsibility to check with the customs about their requirements, say you are not sure, or ""please check with customs"" - do NOT say ""yes everything is okay don't worry"" and take money, twice. It's despicable and not decent like a big company. I never got this mad at a service provider.

Tracking indicates it was ""tendered to delivery service provider"" on Jan. 13. As of Jan. 24, eleven days later, it was still there. They even provided me a USPS tracking number fooling me into believing the Post Office had it. USPS told me on Jan 23 they did not have it. Finding a valid customer service phone number for DHL was an even greater endeavor since it was not provided in their tracking email to me.After finding it and being on hold for 10 minutes, I elected to give my phone number so they could call me back without losing my place in the queue - WRONG! They never called back. I called back the next day and did speak with a customer service rep on Jan 24 who assured me that even though the package was still sitting there in GA that it would be delivered to my Florida residence on Jan 25.

Which didn't happen. I called and they apologized (as a standard answer) and the promised to deliver it the next day, updating the tracking information on their website. To make the long story short, I received a text message the next day, informing delivery at 1:50pm. For my surprise, it was not by my door, so I contacted DHL and my peregrination through their departments started there. I double checked the delivery address and the sender included the ZIP CODE between the house number and street number. Which was incorrect and the sender (me) should have been contacted but did not happened! They just decided to deliver ""guessing"" the correct address!!!Two weeks later; tired of waiting for an accurate response, I decided to go to their facility in MIAMI, where I was informed that the driver couldn't remember where he delivered, but he knew the area very well. I spent many many hours on the phone and exchanging emails with DHL different departments but at a point I decided to request my personal documents again (money was not the only problem but time was precious at this point).On my last attempt, I sent an email to their CEO, which is a suggestion on their Website for situations like mine and I received a very standard answer from an assistant. Their finally answer was that the driver RECALLS the house he delivered the envelope, when the GPS location is showing no specific house in a middle of a street. It is a shame that a company where their main core is ""DELIVERY SAFELY AND ACCURATELY"" uses a driver's memory recall to inform delivery location instead of a GPS!!!

review-3196699,Verified Reviewer,"Friends, allow me to share my little ongoing experience with DHL... I had to post an important international shipment letter from Germany to India through DHL. The letter was posted with registration (**) on 12-Dec-2017 in Dusseldorf, Germany. For the following 21 days (!), I could see NO update on the DHL website, so I had absolutely NO idea what the status is. And every other day, I kept calling my recipient in India (yes, at my own cost!) to see if the letter has arrived or not. Imagine the stress... After 21 days on 02-Jan-2018, I got to see the first update in their website that the letter has arrived in India and is waiting for customs clearance. Where my letter had been floating during these 3 weeks and WHY there was NO status update in between is beyond my imagination. What's more, until today, 05-Jan-2018, this is the same and only damn status that I keep seeing on DHL website.My attempted call to DHL on 05-Jan-2018 at 11:41h CET was met with a guy, who could well be a robot. OK, he was a human but trained to speak like a robot with ZERO sensitivity and ZERO feeling, as he kept on telling me that he has no idea why it took so long... How long more do I have to wait and ""I wish you nevertheless a good day""!! Give me a break... Is this the kind of PAID service that you expect to get from DHL? Do they really belong in 21st century? I have serious doubts. My 2 cents to whoever needs to use DHL for international shipments as a private customer >> be prepared to face such consequences and plan to post your letter at least 4 weeks in advance, if not more... Seriously, this company has lost all my respect and trust. I just wish Amazon had postal services or starts to think about introducing one to kick these lazy carriers out of business.

No one from DHL came yesterday, and this morning I got a call from the same DHL representative I'd spoken to telling me that the package would definitely be delivered today.

The representative said that it would be delivered on Tuesday, even though the tracking still said ""by end of day."" She had no explanation for that and said she couldn't do anything about it (again, I suspect the real explanation is ""everyone went home for the holidays so we can't bother to deliver your package"").I asked to speak to a manager and was put on hold. I have now been on hold for 1 hour and 2 minutes, with an automatic message repeatedly telling me ""you're just moments away from speaking to an authorized customer representative"" and ""a customer service representative will be with you shortly,"" so I'm hanging up.

review-3132356,Verified Reviewer,"I'd give them 0 stars if I could. Just horrible. With the amount of time I've spent waiting for my package to arrive, I'd have been able to order and receive it TWICE by now. I have so much more respect for USPS, having dealt with the horrible service of DHL. Living in Pennsylvania, I had ordered a very small package from Ohio (which borders Pennsylvania). It's essentially a hop, skip and jump. Having ordered items from Ohio before, every other shipping company (UPS, FedEx, USPS) has been able to deliver said items in 2 to 3 days tops. DHL TOOK A WHOPPING 7 DAYS for something that should only take 2 OR 3 DAYS. Most of the wait time was the package simply sitting in some warehouse for several days.Best part is that DHL didn't even deliver the damn package. They delivered it to USPS, which then delivered my package (same day they received. I might add). So I'm basically sitting here wondering what the POINT of using DHL. Oh right... cutting cost. For whatever reason, eBay sellers will do ANYTHING to cut costs. I get how it is, being a seller myself, but to force your customers to go through such horribly slow shipping times so that you can save a few pennies... That's just wrong and the seller will certainly be receiving negative feedback from me. Any person that uses DHL for domestic shipping in the United States is an absolute tool, and frankly, shouldn't be allowed to mail anything if they can't bother to use USPS like a normal person.

review-3062656,Verified Reviewer,"Please do not use DHL to ship to customers and -- customers -- don't let a company use DHL to ship to you. I do in fact have the parcel now, but in spite of DHL's system, not because of it. So -- this is a review detailing supremely bad service. My complaints are provided as a warning to others, and a suggestion to DHL that they improve their service or step away from this business. Recently DHL misdelivered a parcel from Central Asia to me TWICE, and DHL still does not know where it was delivered. (I do know, because someone at the wrong address eventually kindly accepted and signed for it for me. So I have it.)The advertised ""on-demand"" service does not exist. I talked to: a Customer Service Rep, a Supervisor, another Supervisor, and someone in ""Research"" (supposed to help with a problem). In addition I emailed the office of the President, and had exchanges with someone there who did not help at all and who also did not read my emails as far as I can tell from replies. In addition to this, I spent hours trying to reach anyone at all on the phone when I had new information for them, in particular to tell them I'd found the thing. Everyone I talked to insisted that DHL has NO WAY of communicating with their delivery people, at all! So if they drop your stuff in the wrong place -- that's it!!! Make our own decision about whether that will work for you.[If you want the longer version: I heard from DHL that my parcel had reached Istanbul. I called DHL to find out how to arrange delivery, as I'd need to travel to the address here in the US, a place that I'm furnishing that I have not yet moved into. I was assured over and over that DHL would contact me when parcel reached local US airport, and then I could make an arrangement. All I needed to arrange at this point was the DAY, so I could go there and be there when the delivery came. Parcel arrives in US, DHL never contacted me. On Friday I receive a text saying they had tried to deliver parcel but ""no one was there.""I called DHL and made a new arrangement for them to deliver it to me at my present address on Monday -- someone is always there, and as I had seen that DHL was not reliable, I decided it was better for them to take this thing -- a big heavy rug -- to my present address. I planned then to have my movers move it when I eventually move my other things to new address, even though this would of course cost me extra when I move. Object is a rug I had wanted delivered to the place where I was going to use it. DHL emails me to confirm the new arrangement. I notice on this confirmation email that the new delivery address appears, but so does the old address, mingled with it; also there is an inaccurate and confusing piece of extra information included on new address (it says, Broadway at 11th Street, which is correct. It also says, ""entrance on 80th Street,"" which is impossible).Also, the date of promised delivery is wrong. Also, they have listed a phone number where I cannot be reached -- I had provided my cell number on all forms, and on the phone, BUT DHL, or ""their system,"" picked up a number I happened to call from, and printed that on the form instead of the number I consistently provided. SO I CALL DHL and advise them of all these mistakes. Person on phone, supervisor, insists that they don't matter. On date when second delivery is expected, DHL texted me to say the parcel was delivered - but it was not! It was delivered - somewhere! but not where they had agreed to take it. Hours of emails and phone calls with people who did nothing. All of them insisting there was no way for them to find out where the parcel was. I was told they would take ""several days"" to trace this mistake that had occurred just that day. No way to contact drivers who had dropped off a giant rug within the last hour or so.Someone at the original delivery address, not the address where they were supposed to go on this day, recognized my name, let me know that this package was there, and that had signed for it. (By the way -- I don't like inconveniencing a new neighbor, particularly by dumping a 40 pound object on her.) More hours of attempted phone calls to DHL, but now ""research"" would not answer. No way to tell them the thing had been found. People in other departments who answered the phone insisted that a) there was no way to reach the delivery people and also b) there was no way for ANYONE to notify delivery people to stop looking for the parcel. The next day, I received a flurry of garbage emails about how ""this is not typical of DHL."" I replied to all of them asking them to tell me where my package was delivered, and got one totally incorrect answer. I.e., DHL still does not know, or care, where their couriers took this thing.Also a stern note about how I could file a claim but must do so in 30 days or -- my bad luck. I didn't receive a single communication from anyone who seemed to have a clue what had happened. I don't want to file a claim, as I have my property. I did want to see if anybody would ever say something that made sense, but no one has. Some of these interactions were with ""the President's office,"" some with ""research.""]

If some delivery person can't find an address, why can't they call and confirm instead of delivering important stuff to some random home? Please be careful while using DHL service if you are sending valuable documents.

review-2998783,Verified Reviewer,"Case 1: Bad attitudes of the delivery man and without fulfilling the promise of the ""door to door"" service. Case 2: Lying and irresponsible. Lying just because someone did not want to walk upstairs and left my stuff irresponsibly somewhere without noticing me. I am so shocked the bad things happened to me within just 2 days. I don't know it's the same delivery man or not. But from now on I will use Hermes instead of DHL delivery service, even I used its services over decades. Disappointed.Case 1: As I always know, the packages should be delivery ""at my door."" I live on 4th floor and to be a better customer, I wait EVERY TIME for your colleague on the 2nd floor to pick up my stuff. However, if it is between 3 and 7 kg, I will politely ask your colleague to bring it to ""my door"" because I have herniated disc problems and lifting heavy stuff will hurt my back. But shockingly, this time, the delivery man simply said ""No. Why?"" and just put it in the centre of the ground floor lobby after I had politely explained to him about my situation. His ""so what"" and ""I don't care"" attitudes really pissed me off. When I asked him for his name, he simply refused my request again and just turned away to his delivery van leaving me and the package alone in the lobby! If he didn't want to bring my stuff to my door at the 4th floor (even it's his job), could he tell me the reason and let us together figure it out how to get it done, instead of such indifferent and impolite attitudes?Case 2: The delivery man rang my bell and I answered him that I lived on the 4th floor. Then, he said nothing. I went downstairs and waited for the delivery man on the 2nd floor as usual. After a couple minutes, nobody showed up. Then I felt weird and went to the lobby of the ground floor, then I met a neighbour of mine and he told me that the delivery man said he COULD NOT FIND MY NAMEPLATE AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE. (So, how could he ring my bell???) 
                        
                    
                        
                            Then I called the service center that I could not receive my package and the guy from the service centre told me that the delivery man HAS ALREADY INSERT IT INTO MY MAILBOX. Frankly, I was scared to death because the stuff was quite important. I kept asking the people around and finally and luckily I got it back.Frankly, I don't mind the delivery man doesn't want to WALK. But, please tell me where he wants to stuff my package or simply tell me that he doesn't want to walk and just wants to insert it into my mailbox. I don't mind. BUT, DON'T, EVER, LIE.

I came home to find a sign indicating that the package will be delivered again tomorrow. I had a roommate wait in the apartment the following day to sign the package for me. However, the person delivering the package did not buzz the door nor came up to the apartment. My roommate went downstairs to find a ""I'm sorry we missed you"" package slip on the apartment building door. I then called DHL and told them to send the package to a shipping facility, since delivering packages at home has been proven too difficult.The address of the closest shipping facility they provided me with is not easily accessible by public transportation, so I had the shipping address changed to another local shipping facility. I was assured by DHL Customer Service that the package would be there by 9 AM on Nov. 1st. I called that shipping facility at 10 AM, who informed me the package was not there yet, but would be arriving that same afternoon. Due to my work schedule, I was not able to pick up the package until the following day. Before leaving my apartment, I checked the package's tracking number and saw that it had been signed for by a representative. Great! The package has arrived at the shipping facility!Upon arriving to the shipping facility, which took me 25 minutes to get there, I was told the package was not there!!! I then had to call DHL Customer Service again to acquire where is my package, if it had been signed for??? Lo and behold DHL had sent my package to the shipping facility that is not easily accessible for me, after assuring me it would be sent to the shipping facility I can access. NO one notified me, or informed me that the package was sent to the wrong place! What kind of customer service is that? Now not only is my package very late, but I have to be inconvenienced yet again to go to the same shipping facility in the next few days hoping that DHL has finally sent it to the correct place. I will never, ever use this company's services again. Absolutely horrible!

I will contact the vendor Monday to see if they can resend the package at their expense through FedEx or deal with getting the item out of the EU (my understanding is that the EU does allow batteries included as package for an item that will contain batteries and if the batteries are below a certain size). I've had goods shipped via DHL four or five times in the past. They prefer that customers make a trip to Managua (2 and a half hours by bus one way for me) to clear customs themselves; they completely lost one package from Amazon, two packages that were transferred to the Nicaragua Postal system arrived, and I'm also seeing what is happening with the second package of the order which I will have to pick up at the local DHL office on Tuesday. They tell B&H Photo that they do door-to-door delivery, but, unlike FedEx, do not.

review-2744017,Verified Reviewer,"This story is about a small parcel I had ordered from India to be sent to London. I do not live in London, so I had asked to send it to a London post office Post restante. British Mail generously offers this institution so one can send mail to the post office and collect it there. The sender of the parcel, an Ayurvedic firm, send their wellness products only to Commonwealth countries, so I had to come all the way from Germany to London. Shortly before I left for London I was asked by DHL India to send the phone number of the place where I was staying in London a hotel, so I sent the phone number. Much later I inquired why the parcel was not targeted to the Post Office but the hotel instead, and I got the answer that DHL delivers only when a phone number is given. Can this be? In Germany this is not a condition with DHL. When I was at the hotel there was a note that I should call DHL UK which I did. I was informed that I had to pay the VAT tax of 23 pounds which I was willing to do. BUT: the customs clearance Center of DHL UK insisted that payment had to be made through a credit card registered in the UK which I naturally dont have. I was told this was: Due to security and fraud prevention. Well, I wonder what kind of fraud might have been involved paying 23 Pounds with an international credit card, and what kind of security might have been endangered... From then on there was frequent email correspondence between the customs clearance Center and me. Accidentally I met a DHL driver on the street and asked him whether the payment could be made in cash, too. Of course, he said: ""We do this all the time"". I proposed to pay cash to DHL, but the lady, I call her Mrs. **, said that this was not possible. In her words: If we pull the shipment and deliver as a Same day, we cannot collect the cash on delivery. I did not quite understand this sentence in insider language and asked for its meaning but in vain, did not get an explanation I could understand. Meanwhile, in a second phone call, an employee of the hotel offered to pay the VAT charge through her own credit card which WAS British. She argued with DHL for a while but finally gave up. They would not accept even that. I asked for the guidelines of DHL governing all of this junk behavior but was told they are confidential. Imagine: There is a company you are dealing with, and they refuse to tell you according to which rules they operate... After a couple of days and after I had been back in Germany, without the parcel, I started to complain with DHL UK. I did not address it to the people Mrs. ** had named, but to an address which had the nice designation of To the top, found on the homepage of DHL. So now I was in contact with the Executive Customer Relations Department. Needless to say that in any of the mails I got they VERY MUCH apologized for any inconvenience they produced, and mails were exchanged for about three weeks. Meanwhile I had proposed that they send the parcel to Germany to which they agreed (!). But this Executive Customer Relations Department also demanded that I pay the VAT charge through a British-issued credit card which I naturally dont have. One has to remember: I can pay anything, around the world by a credit card, regardless in which country it is issued. But NOT with DHL GB. Now I had to find someone in England who would pay the charge for me to get the parcel. I told the person in the Executive Customer Relations Department that the hotel employee HAD once offered to pay it before (refused by DHL customs dept.) and the Executive Customer Relations Department agreed THAT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE! Well, now it was too late. So I activated a friend who has friends in England to ask them if they would be ready to pay the 23 Pounds with a British-issued credit card. This was agreed upon with the Executive Customer Relations Department, and I tried my best to arrange this. And then, two days later - without a warning - they informed me that they had sent the parcel back to India!! And they certainly give a nice, easy reason for this, I suppose: Nonpayment of the VAT charge... Now how would you feel if you had been treated like this? Can you understand now why Brexit negotiations with the British dont work and will not work?I asked myself what might have been the reason(s) for all of this: Laziness to deliver on a Friday (I was in London only on Friday and Saturday)? Bureaucratic inflexibility? Suspicion that the content might have been dangerous in some respect? Well, then they might have simply checked it; An aversion to Ayurvedic products? (Remember: The British colonialists prohibited and suppressed the traditional Ayurvedic medicine in India!); Old British hatred against Germany because of World War II? I dont know. I'm at a loss to figure this out. But one thing I know: No DHL GB.

review-2702706,Verified Reviewer,"We posted some children's clothes from Saudi Arabia to the U.K. and being in Saudi, the DHL office insists on checking the contents before sealing the package. The clothes were birthday presents for my grandchildren and Children's clothes are VAT exempt in the U.K. but the clerk in the Saudi office incorrectly filled out the form omitting the word children's. My grandchildren are 5 and 6 so quite obviously the clothes were for children.DHL tried to claim a £20 fee on delivery which was £9 tax and £11 admin fee so I called the Saudi office and within 24 hours received a reply saying it was an error on their part, the parcel would be delivered later that day with no charge. The delivery driver went to drop the parcel and still wanted to charge the fee, my son contacted me whilst he was there and after many international calls the driver eventually left the package. My son offered to open the package in front of the driver to show the contents were children's clothes but he declined.Now many days later both myself and my son are receiving regular texts and emails trying to extort the £20 despite me now having emails from both Saudi and the GB customer relations saying no fee is payable. I copied the CEO (Phil Couchman) in on many emails yet obviously he hasn't bothered to reply or intervene. Now that I've spoken to many friends working as expats in the GCC region, this practice with DHL is far too common. You sent something to a family member and DHL as the professionals get to incorrectly complete your documentation and charge a fee in excess of the tax and here is the best bit... to change the tax back to the correct figure of zero costs an admin fee of £30.This was a parcel with tax free children's clothes and quite frankly it would have been easier and taken less time to put them in a suitcase and fly to the U.K. Now in order to force them to cease harassing my family is to report them to Trading Standards. So, ask yourself. Is it easier to buy online in the country you want the goods sent and get delivery within that country avoiding DHL or easier to find a professional delivery company that is not run by Fagin? The telephone calls alone exceed the value of the parcel let alone the many wasted hours for me and my family. I wish I had never dealt with DHL and it's just a shame that you have to give at least 1 star!

review-2701080,Verified Reviewer,"I ordered a clothing article from the UK based site ASOS. Prior to ordering I was unaware that they shipped via DHL or I might have thought twice about placing the order. I was very eager to receive the package and paid an extra $10 for the express shipping which took the shipping time from approximately 8 business days (12 days) to three business days (5 days). On the third business day, Wednesday, the tracking updated to say my package was with the delivery person and would be delivered later that day. Only a few hours later the tracking updated again only this time to say ""address information needed"". I had never had such a message before and called DHL to inquire. They informed me that the delivery person could not locate my house (which I have never experienced despite ordering items from many different companies).The woman I spoke with seemed to be incredibly confused about how to proceed, first asking me if I would like to change the address then stating that she could not do that and I would have to describe my location. I did so and she informed me that my package would be with the delivery person again in about 48 hours and to keep an eye on the tracking information. The following day (Thursday) the tracking had updated but only to say again that address information was needed. To ensure that there wasn't a problem I called again. The woman I spoke to this time informed me once again that everything was updated and fine and it would be shipped to me the following day. Today (Friday) I called again after 4 pm because once again there was no notification. The woman who I spoke with this time told me that the status had not be updated, and that she would update it now. This means that the package should arrive to me on Tuesday!I have my doubts as the only additional information this delivery person will have was my description of my location typed up by the first customer service rep I spoke with. Never in my life have I had such an issue and had to call THREE times before the information was even updated. DHL is by far the most lazy and disorganized company I have ever encountered.

review-2595516,Verified Reviewer,"Unlike many customers here, I have to say that all packages sent to me via DHL actually did arrive (eventually) and arrived in acceptable (although not pristine) condition. That's why I gave DHL one more star than my feelings about the company would support. The two problems that I have about DHL are their total lack of any sort of 'customer service' or support for the people receiving packages sent via DHL and their unbelievably slow shipping times.Their so-called ""Customer Service"" people are even more blatant than their competitors about letting you know that you aren't really considered a ""customer"" -- so far as they are concerned, only the shippers are their customers, and only the major companies with exclusive DHL contracts really count. There's a reason DHL is normally pronounced ""D H Hell"" by those who have suffered through having a package shipped via this company.Their tracking system is less reliable than UPS or FedEx (about as bad as USPS) but so far as I have been able to tell their actual routes only add about one day to the delivery time on packages to my city. We are a major Interstate junction in the central US, so a typical DHL or FedEx package actually passes through here on its way to their nearest ""hub"" before being hauled back here the next day. Although the route adds only that one day to the transit time, the WAY the company handles packages usually adds a few more days.Unlike other shippers that operate more-or-less 24/7, it seems that DHL operates on a daily cycle so that each time a package reaches one of their hubs, it has to stay there until the next day before moving on to the next hub. If a package reaches a hub in the daytime, it won't move on to the next hub until AT LEAST the next day. Sometimes the tracking data will show a package sitting at one of their hubs for several days. If you call to ask what's happening, no one knows but the usual GUESS is that your package is PROBABLY in transit somewhere and just wasn't scanned.I avoid having packages shipped by DHL, but in too many instances online you simply don't have any choice for basic shipping unless you want to 'upgrade' to obscenely expensive options like Next Day Air. Most online vendors don't even tell you how they are going to ship your purchase, and especially not when they are saying ""free shipping"" (nothing is really free, they just include the shipping in the price).

They left a note with a statement: One, who is not home has to lift/drag heavy by himself!Is this a joke? What rude and stupid people are working in this company. They are making fun of the customer, as they were kids. What kind of statement is this to write? I then called the customer service, which was very cold, and only told me that they cannot deliver again today, I have to wait two days, or I can pick it up. I told the unfriendly lady that I ordered the wardrobe online because I can’t lift the huge package and I don't have a car. Duhhh, she has not even apologized and said, “I can’t say more than that. The package is already at the post office, you have to open the door immediately.” I asked her what she means by immediately, am I standing by the door waiting every second the bell will ring, they should at least ring twice and wait at least half a minute.

But they said custom not inspected and I should pay only online. So asked to keep track on it. So tracked every day and called them for five days continuously. Replied same. All of a sudden the parcel was sent back. Blaming me for wrong phone number. Though I had been talking to customers service every day, customer service and brokerage had no proper communication. I can only talk to customers service. They said everything fine only waiting for customs charges.Now shipper has to pay 480 HK dollars to take back and send them back with remote area extra fee (which was paid already), additional another US$200, and I lost business too. All together US$300 loss, but product cost only US$130. Who will pay? This is not first time, I buy same item from same DHgate (eBay) 3-4 time a year, every time communication is the problem. They have email/address in file. Why don't they send email.

Tracking was good and had no problems until when it was finally delivered. My address was supposed to be Canada Post FlexDelivery in my city (I'm always at work during delivery hours) but the ** part of it was that DHL NEVER uses PO Box numbers as the shipping address (didn't know about this when I phoned in). I got a phone call from my former boss at my previous job saying that there was a parcel for me. Turns out that the parcel was shipped to their work address instead of my street address. I NEVER added nor used it when I made my orders online.But wait it gets better: DHL never called me about this change. I phoned customer service about this and put in the waybill # to them.

The same website that insists they will contact me within 72 hrs. 4 days later and I have heard nothing. The seller is no help, insisting they have no further information beyond what is available through the tracking service (and showing little remorse). With no other course of action I contact the customer service department again through website. However I ask my housemate to give them a call.Finally, today, Thursday 14th June, I get told that package was passed to a local service delivery provider hence the delay. This was from the UPS delivery guy though as I STILL have not heard anything back from DHL customer service.

So I called and asked if the carrier could call me so I could meet him to sign for it since I work during those hours. I was told that they could not do that. (But it was done in the past.

However, since I work till 530pm, I called asked the carrier to drop the package off at my apt office. It was never done. Since they missed the office hours of the apt office.

We filled the stupid form in website and they send automatic useless e-mail with no reply. Just saying ""we received your application"" and so on. We tried to find a solution after few months. We find a friend who knows a friend who works in DHL management. The same thing happen. He even called Hagan DHL. They found the bag, they told him ""We damaged the bag so we didn't send it to Jordan."" So they took my money 69.99 Euros for shipping my bag, they damage it instead and they never called my number. They never send me e-mail. They never cared of saying anything. So the friend of friend said to Hagan what is the solution? They don't have any professional systems in this DHL company. Everything is random and ignorant service. One time they say we will empty the bag and put in box and send it to Offenburg, Germany. Then later no let him first write the form in website or we won't take any action for this matter. I fill the stupid form. They even ask to provide all the invoices for my used clothes for God sake!!! Does anyone keeps the invoices of a used clothes??!! I filled the form but I didn't have any invoice of my clothes to provide them with. So until now I am stuck in this endless problem. Later they said that they will destroy any storage that is lost and it's been more than 6 month in theirs!! But hey I found the bag and this is my own stuff so why you destroy my bag?!! I want my stuff. Hello!! Nothing. They said we will pay him 500 Euros crap. My stuff inside the bag is more expensive than 500 Euros. In the end I still wait for my respond about anything, the case it looks like it's closed to DHL. They even removed the shipping tracking number from the website after few days of complaining. You will find nothing in the website anymore. There is no reply. The friend of friend he said that sorry but DHL workers are not a German people they are outsiders (that's how they call foreigners in Germany). So outsiders are not professional, and what does this mean to me? They stole my bag and took the 69.99 Euros as extra fees for taking my stuff?! :(

I'm sorry but... jeez. I've never, ever had any issue with FedEx, UPS, and or USPS. Anyhow, I recently decided I wanted to build my own computer. So okay, so many different websites with high prices... But I finally settled with picking different parts from Ebay. So, my graphics card, motherboard, PC case, AND Ram was from Newegg. So I thought, alright. It was on Sunday, April 23 that I ordered everything. Two days later, my case, graphics card, AND motherboard appeared at my house after school. Why? Because the carrier was FedEx. My RAM hadn't even been shipped. So I sent Newegg an email because I knew everything else was also from there. Mind you I didn't get a response till yesterday, the 26th. The 25th, I check, and there it is, saying DHL was the company. Never heard of it. After some research? I knew it was all over. So many complaints... Holy shrimp. And some people had the same issue with the same type of thing, RAM. How hard can it be for two little sticks to arrive at my house? For two days the page was stuck at ""EN ROUTE TO DHL E-COMMERCE DISTRIBUTION CENTER"". UGH. Mind you, the rest of the parts from elsewhere got to my house by Wednesday. It wasn't until today, Friday that apparently it has left the facility. I sure hope so. I get everything within 3 days, except for the smallest and most essential part. RAM. And it says the Estimated Delivery Date is not until May 3. WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. HOW AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FRUSTRATED?!? Why couldn't have FedEx shipped that too. Ugh...

On April 5, I received a text from DHL indicating that it would be delayed until April 10. I changed the delivery address to an alternate address as would not be at original delivery address, and received confirmation it had been changed to be delivered on April 11. On April 7, I received a text that it was out for delivery. I called to confirm the address and was told it had missed a scan and was on the way to original address. As it required a delivery signature, I stayed home ALL DAY. Late that evening, the status was updated to Recipient refused delivery, which was not true unless they delivered to incorrect address. I worked with the Amazon seller who contacted DHL, and they indicated it would be delivered to the alternate address as requested on April 11.On April 11, the status was still showing as Recipient refused delivery. I called DHL and spoke with 2 reps, who indicated they did not know where the package was, and it would take 24-48 hours to contact the DHL facility. They assured me I would hear from them by 5pm the next day (April 12). Later that day it was updated to With Delivery Courier. So of course I stayed home again ALL DAY, and it was never delivered. That evening the status was updated to Recipient Moved. Which is ridiculous as I had 2 other packages delivered to me yesterday from Amazon by UPS and USPS. Next day status updates to indicate it went to incorrect facility.I emailed DHL CEO yesterday and received a reply from the ""Executive Response and Social Customer Care"" rep. This was after I was on hold for 15 minutes to talk to a supervisor who never called me back. Delivery was promised for today by Executive Response member ~ and now I see it had been shipped back to Cincinnati where it was a week ago. How is it possible that a package can spend a week bouncing between every destination but my front door? I have never in my life had an issue with FedEx, UPS or USPS. If there is a delay, they are able to identify the package location in real time and will deliver at the earliest possible time the next day.I have no idea if or when I will ever receive this package. There is a delivery signature required, and while I was told I could remove that option, who in their right mind would do so given the ineptitude up to this point with delivery. For all I know, a driver could toss it off the truck and mark delivered, and I would have no recourse. My experience with DHL is such that I would never purchase an item if I knew this was the carrier. I can't believe in this day and age with all the technology available that DHL can't do better in delivering packages and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.

As I am on medication from South Africa I need to get it every month from abroad, because it is the law. I cannot get say 3 months medication in one delivery. It must be only one month at a time. It cost me an fortune but I do need it to live. The problems started when one of my medication packets was only 15 tablets in and not 30. I called DHL and they said I must called this number and then another number and I just gave up. So the next month came and again the same medication packet had only half the amount in. I called again my pharmacy in South Africa and they said if this are going to continued once more they will be by law not allowed to send my medication because it is very high scheduled drug that go missing from them to me. I called DHL again, and they said I must asked the sender of the parcel. They really don't gave me any help at all. Today was my delivery date for my new medication parcel. Then suddenly everything changed. Instead of delivery it went to an red flag to say parcel been held due to no payment for import. So I called DHL and the lady told me, ""Sorry your parcel will be here kept for 24 hours as it is been tag as an red flag on DHL computer systems."" So I told her that is impossible and that I already paid the 19 pound. She told me that it has nothing to do with any payment, and that DHL do this very much lately with all the parcels. I was so shocked about it, and asked her to whom I can speak to because this is my daily medication we are talking about and not an box of chocolates. She told me I can talk to her manager but nothing can be done. The parcel is red flagged so I just have to wait until maybe tomorrow. After an bit over 5 years dealing with DHL every month and cost me 120 pound minimum every month just for delivery of my monthly medications I had finally enough. There must be an better and cheaper way to get my medication to me in time, and not to suffer without it. Thanks to DHL!!!

Before I paid Eur 69,90 for a package of 100 grams by DHL Express Easy, I checked thoroughly into the website. It says 2 days to Taipei. Two days after, the package had not arrived. It is shown in the tracking that the package went from Germany to East China Area, then Zhejiang, then back to East China Area, then Hong Kong. It is clearly written that the shipment arrived at incorrect facility in Zhejiang. I called DHL customer service to complain. Instead of an apology to me, he said that the package finally arrived on the 5th day anyway whether it was 2 days or 5 days. He further said that 2-Days delivery on the brochure was only an indication, not a guarantee. DHL obviously advertises its express service that it cannot deliver and does not feel responsible. The story goes on.On the 5th day my husband checked out from the hotel, at that time not hearing anything from DHL when the package would actually arrive. Then someone from the hotel traced him back to pick up the package, though he did not authorize anyone to receive the package on his behalf. He spent 65 Euro for a taxi to go back and forth to pick up the package. I also complained to DHL about this and referred a clause on DHL brochure and website that this Express Easy shipment will only be sent to the recipient personally or to an authorized person.The customer service responded by saying DHL only delivers door to door, no time to find the recipient. Then I knew that it was just hopeless to spend another minute to complain, and I hanged up. I could have gone to a Consumer Center in Germany and fight for the consumer right, but it would cost me another 1-2 days. I rather share this experience to the world.

Recently, I ordered a $20 ceramic item from a US retailer, paid $25 in shipping to have it expressed shipped to me. I already felt ridiculous paying more for shipping than for the actual item. Once the item was delivered, I was hit with $22 ""duties"" at the door. Keep in mind, the delivery man had specified these are ""duties"". I also was not notified of the amount ahead of time as they usually do to give you the option to pay duties online, so this really did come as a surprise to me. Feeling upset and ripped off, I submitted a complaint via the company's website as they claim to value feedback. I was emailed back basically with an explanation as to why I was charged ridiculously. I didn't initially ask for an explanation. I simply wanted to let them know I will no longer be using their service and have advised friends and family against it as well. You know, since they apparently value feedback. I was also sent a invoice of the charges and noticed that I was only charged $1.89 in duties which is absolutely fair. What's NOT fair is the $10.50 and $4.50 DHL charges in brokerage processing fees and transaction fees, and I was also charged GST on those fees. They like to cover up their fees by claiming you owe ""duties"", which is dishonest and disgusting. The lady who emailed me tried to advise me on how I could ""avoid"" paying these brokerage fees in the future by opting for self clearance. THANK YOU for letting me know after I get ripped off.

I ordered some clothing from a Chinese retailer (I'm in the US). I knew that shipping would take a while but wasn't worried as I've ordered things from other companies like this previously. Usually it gets sent through the USPS and I have to go pick it up from my local office. This company used DHL, worst choice ever. Tracking isn't detailed enough to begin with. It tells you nothing as to where your package is in the world, just that it's out there. When tracking finally said that it had been delivered and I had nothing show up on my doorstep I opened a claim with DHL. They gave me the usual spiel of ""check with your neighbors and anyone in your household"". I don't live in a bad neighborhood but I don't really know my neighbors.No one outside of my own household would have accepted the package on my behalf and my door isn't even visible from the street so theft wasn't likely. DHL said since their tracking showed that it was delivered so I was pretty much screwed. Fine. I went to Paypal and got my money back through them since they always side with the buyer. I always figured they were my fail safe anyway but I wanted to try and hold DHL accountable for their sub par service first.Well, about a week after dealing with DHL a woman knocks on my door with my package. She apologized for not coming by sooner, she didn't have the time. Not a problem for me. I was over the moon she brought it by at all. The truly horrible thing was that she didn't live in my neighborhood... didn't even have the same zip code as me, her address was nothing like mine. Why would a delivery driver drop a package at a random house and mark it as delivered? How is that even remotely doing your job? And DHL stands by the word of their drivers, people who do careless work like this. So in summation, you'd have better luck relying on the kindness of random strangers to get your package where it needs to be rather than sending it through DHL.

On December 12 I received a text message from DHL indicating my package would be delivered that day. No package ever arrived. Thinking it was a busy time I let some time go. Waiting patiently. Finally a few days before Christmas I checked the tracking and saw that it said it had been delivered. When I contacted customer service they said they would open an investigation for me. A few days later a woman called me and said ""sorry tracking said it was delivered. We checked the driver's GPS and he delivered the package."" Well excuse me because I don't have a package here so please explain that to me.

review-2073176,Verified Reviewer,"I was in Frankfurt, Germany two weeks ago and discovered some popular delicious German treats that I decided to give as presents this year. I ordered on 12/09/16, the company shipped via DHL Paket on 12/12/16, and the package was supposed to be here on Monday, 12/20/16. DHL Paket had the last scan in their warehouse on 13/12/16 and it has not been seen since. I called DHL USA and they said they cannot do anything for me because this package was shipped from DHL Paket. So I asked, ""Why is this impossible for you to track, it's your company."" The agent said, ""Europe uses a 12 digit number and USA uses a 10 digit number."" So again I asked, ""Don't you use the same computer system to track packages, regardless of how many digits are involved?"" I got no direct answer but was given a number to call DHL Paket direct to inquire. So now I started to deal with DHL Paket. I called their number on Tuesday, a woman answered, started to speak German, and I ended our call after we could not communicate. I called back Wednesday, another woman answered, and in broken English told me to call back in 2 hours. Now I am on the West Coast of the USA and these calls were made after 1am when the DHL Paket call center is open. I finally decided to send them another email, they answered, and told me now that the company that shipped my products from Germany has to open an investigation. Now I cannot even get a confirmation email from the shipper telling me if the investigation was opened because the administration offices are closed for Christmas and possibly thru the new year. Overall this whole experience is plagued by very poor communication. This is definitely not the first time DHL has screwed up my shipments from Europe and I am so done with this company. When I buy products from Europe again, I will only ship with UPS or FedEx because at least they can scan any or all tracking numbers generated within any of their companies. Now I am scrambling to buy more presents because a shipping company cannot do what I paid them a lot of money to do.

The shipment left on November 4th from China and should arrive by 8th and we have still not received it.Once the shipment left, the DHL Forwarding representative contacted us with the info that the fee raised by over $1000 as there were 2 cm more volume than what we said. This info is still not confirmed as we have still not received our goods... We said that we have to check that upon arrival and will pay if it is correct. The goods did not arrive on 8th November and our DHL did not help with follow up but said that it is not their fault - no excuse and no info was received on when the goods will arrive. As we had over 10 people reserved for the quality control of this cargo on 8th/9th, we were obliged paying them a full day of work without having worked for us!As on 8th still no more info and only rude emails telling us to be patient and forwarding is emails from their DHL China subsidiary, we researched where the goods were and found that they are stuck in Luxembourg by error!!!

How they evaluate, no idea: we have paid and asked for their fastest service.We contested the shipping charge and asked for a new reduced offer in regards of all the loss we have to account. DHL forwarding's answer was: ""you need to pay the full higher amount upfront, otherwise we will not deliver you your goods at all and block them."" We had no choice than to pay fully in order to receive our goods the fastest possible...Next day, we found out that the goods have flown back to China!!! And that we will be delivered by the 12th earliest! We researched and got in touch with Cargolux as our goods went from China a second time back to Luxembourg!!! They were very professional and confirmed that the goods will travel to Switzerland by truck overnight and will arrive 12th of November in Zurich. End of the day on 11th we receive an email from DHL informing us that we cannot pickup the goods on 12th and they will only be available on Monday 14th!!! Calling them no answer on any of their direct phone numbers!My business partner went to Zurich himself as we are about to lose our client as we are very much delayed with delivery of this order caused by DHL but no chance: our goods had arrived to Zurich but were blocked by DHL until Monday 14th November! So we again had to cancel our employees for their scheduled work over the weekend... Tomorrow we will hopefully finalize this review and receive our shipment! We recommend anybody to choose any other Express Service but DHL!

review-1969532,Verified Reviewer,"I've being scheduling pickup of Express package for entire business week starting on Monday and the package still haven't been picked up on Friday. I called customer service and they told me that they cancelled pickup because the driver could not find my address and that some neighbor told him that the business moved. Supervisor Carry ** who I spoke over the phone with on Friday evening kept on convincing me that they could not find the place for all these days yet there was no updates on the account/pickup information and every evening I re-schedule the pickup just to see how it's neglected the next day. The fact that all other carriers have no problems in finding the address and that this is unsolvable problem only for the DHL driver for 5 days wasn't good reason for her.Another fact that I've being waiting for the pickup during FIVE days and then re-scheduling the pickup at the end of each day wasn't convincing for the supervisor nor it was alarming for her. All she did was convincing me that this situation is normal and it was all my fault that they could not find a well known address and/or call or leave a voice message in advance about the time of the pickup so that we could make sure that the driver will find us when he's at the address. It looks ridiculous that DHL drivers fail to find a business address and cannot solve the problem during 5 BUSINESS DAYS.My question is what do you do when after you pay money for the service you didn't get it and when the company just mock common sense instead of finding a solution? I've never felt so disappointed. I'm a small business owner doing my best in building a good reputation but it looks like corporate reputation means nothing for people like Carry ** and her co-workers. She refused to provide me with her employee/dispatch identification when I asked for it. Again, I paid for the service and have been waiting for it and haven't get it while losing my business reputation in eyes of my customer who's waiting for my product.

review-1958024,Verified Reviewer,"Being an expat living in Canada, having to renew a passport has a few hurdles. The UK government have an 'agreement' to handle the courier delivery here with DHL... except that the local 'depot' do not deliver in my area, some 25 mins outside of a large city! On speaking with DHL customer service, they blamed EVERYTHING on the passport sender. Would NOT take a complaint when I pointed out that I had NO contact from them, not even a 'please call us' card in the regular post. They say it's not their responsibility!! They say they do not deliver to unsecure Po box addresses. We have our Po box INSIDE the local post office.Apparently it can take around 3 weeks to get a tracking number from DHL (attached to your details with the passport office). In that time DHL had received the document and had sent it back as unable to deliver! DHL have a contract with the UK to handle passport delivery, except if it's not convenient for DHL to Bother to drive out of town. Even with the recent postal strikes, Canada postal service is outshining them every step of the way! So to sum it up, don't bother complaining, it's not their fault, don't bother driving into the depot because they don't have it and don't bother emailing DHL as they can't be bothered to reply. On the whole Canadian people are friendly and caring. Looks like DHL need to 'cowboy-up' and start taking responsibility!!!

They are rude and can hardly speak english there in the international service. All my week is spoiled because of you. You are the most expensive delivery company but it's just horrible. I guess I will have to go to the court 'cause I cant get my parcel. And what makes more sense that it supposed to be a present for the anniversary which has already passed and it's your fault I didnt get it on time and it seems like I wont get it at all.On monday 24.10.16 I found in my place the paper that the parcel was not delivered 'cause they didnt find me at home. So Im wondering why nobody has called me. Am I supposed to stay at home and wait all the day? So I called to the company and they proposed me the delivery on 26.10.16. I explained that I can be at home only in the evening and asked to make a delivery from 16.00 to 18.00. The operator was extremely rude. She replied - ""no, it's too short. We can make from 15.00 to 18.00.""So I asked to give me a call on arrival so I could go home and pick up the parcel and she refused to make this service to me. So I called again to check my delivery time and try to ask to call me and the next operator took my number and promised to send it to the office. So I was waiting my parcel on 26.10.16 from 15.00 to 18.00 and nobody came and no phone call at all. I called again with the question - why they didnt bring the parcel today and the answer was fantastic. They said - ""we dont know"" to my question why nobody has called to me. They said that it's because it is not a french number which is not true because I bought it in france.So they offered the delivery for the next day. I explained that I cant stay at home and wait all the day, I have already lost one day because of you. Nobody calls me and informs me about the arrival. How I supposed to get it? So they said that they can do nothing for me and proposed to collect it in the office. I said that it can be a solution and asked to organise it for me but the operator said that they will call me back tomorrow. I dont know where is the office here, 'cause they didnt give me any address. I dont know how can I get my parcel 'cause nobody delivers it and they never call to me. I've lost my time, I didnt get my present. I must confess that DHL does no effort to do any service for the clients, so it looks like stealing 'cause we have lost my present and money for the delivery.

review-1928567,Verified Reviewer,"We were scheduled for a delivery of a valuable ($4,000), irreplaceable, bulky and heavy shipment today, Friday, that required a signature. I stayed home to be sure to accept the delivery, and regularly monitored the website for the delivery status. I saw that the package was on the delivery vehicle at about 1:30 PM, which could have resulted in a delivery between 2 and 3. When no delivery occurred by 3, I checked the status only to discover that the shipment had been delivered to SOME OTHER ADDRESS with a signature from someone with a DIFFERENT name. I called DHL a little after 3... After assuring the very polite and responsive representative that I had no neighbors with that last name, that the 9' long, 60-80 pound item was not outside my door or visible in front of any house on my block, she scheduled a follow up call in two hours. Because I had been at home all day waiting, I left to run a couple of errands and was gone about 45 minutes. Sure enough, the driver had realized the mistake and attempted to deliver to the correct address - WHILE I WAS OUT. No call to let me know of the re delivery attempt, and because I was told that the next event would be the follow up call at about 5, I was not concerned about missing the delivery. Our address is very easy to find, I regularly buy online and neither UPS nor FedEx have had any problems finding me. DHL's solution? To have me again wait on Monday for the pleasure of receiving my shipment.

review-1906946,Verified Reviewer,"I own and operate an online shopping store, and I signed up with DHL for its Global Mail service for my logistics. Although it offers cheaper shipping costs, the service is, I must say, the worst of its kind. Its customer service takes forever to respond if you have any issues. For instance, I asked for account invoice so that I can make payment, but for weeks, they haven't responded. I also requested for some packaging materials (labels, envelopes etc), and it took them 3 weeks to delivery. Finally, I had one shipment supposed to bound for Los Angeles, CA, and on my part, I made a mistake by using slightly bigger box than its required specification. They informed me that they can't deliver it and would return my parcel. I sent the parcel around September 17, and until now they have no idea as what happened and where it is. I made a mistake, but DHL should still return it to me within a week or so, not three weeks.Anyway, I finally called in and their explanation was they have to sort manually for all returning parcels. It just didn't make sense to me as DHL is one of major courier services and not being able to trace them systematically just shocked me. Anyway, should DHL have returned my parcel I could repack and resend it to my Amazon customer. Instead, I am way behind my fulfillment deadline and would eventually have to refund to the customer. Therefore, for those who are considering the service, these are some of the issues you may face. If you are dealing with high-value merchandises, I strongly suggest that you stay away from DHL and go ahead with more reliable, FedEx or UPS.

That being said, it has been my experience that DHL will lie, cheat, or steal from you to achieve their objective which is your money. DHL promises things that they know not to be true. I sent a letter DHL express to Ukraine from Greece and was promised by DHL it would be delivered within the 3-day period. I relied on those representations and paid them the outrageous amount of €45,00 to deliver the letter. I have sent letters to this same address in Ukraine which takes 4 to 5 days at most for less than €5,00 through the Hellas Postal System which has better tracking than DHL.So I sent the letter DHL to Ukraine. It has now been 5 days, and DHL is claiming a delay, and also telling me that it will take an additional 3 business days to deliver the letter. The DHL tracking website has not updated in 4 days. I had to call DHL to find out where the letter is, and was told it was in the U.K. and would be delivered tomorrow. I just received an email from DHL stating it will be delivered 3 days from now.The people I speak with are polite, and professional on the phone. It's not their fault they work for an incompetent company. DHL has no idea what it is doing. DO NOT USE DHL. Use TNT, FedEx, or your local postal system. I've demanded a refund from DHL. This will confirm how ethical DHL is. I'm not holding my breath.

I only wish I could give less than one star. I ordered an expensive device, and unfortunately the courier used was DHL. First they tried to deliver the parcel to my home address, and since I work until 5PM I was not there to sign for the package so they left a notice to go onto their website for details. I decided to have it sent to my business as I am there all day, thinking of course there would be no issue with this. They even have a box you can check to let them know your business closes at or before 5PM so I clicked it.The next day they attempted to deliver at 5:23PM, when there were people still in the office until after 6PM. I contacted them and they had me fill the form out again for the next day. The same thing happened and they stated they had attempted delivery and no one was there... in an office that had at least 5 people working after 5PM. I then sent an e-mail frustrated advising them on what is happening and asked what I could do, that is when they had me fill out a self-collect form.The next day I received an automated e-mail telling me to check online for when the package was at the pickup location. I then e-mailed the same representative back letting her know I was a little nervous as it was still showing online that they were delivering it to the business again today. She told me ""No, it will be ready at a depot."" Not trusting this information I called them, and the representative on the phone advised me they were in the business’ area, my package was on the truck and they would be dropping it off today. I waited at the office until 5:33PM and no one came.Tomorrow I leave town for business for almost 1 week. I have now been chasing this company I have already paid duties/taxes to, trying to pick up/have delivered my parcel that I’m now very worried will be sent back. Stay away from using this courier.

I called to file a complaint and to make sure the driver would actually deliver the next day.So, it's the next day, and I get a call from my callbox downstairs that DHL is here. I buzz him in and wait for my package to come to my door... except it never does. I then get a notification that my package has not been delivered. WHAT?! So the driver came to my lobby, used the call box, got buzzed in, and then LEFT?! He also had my cell phone on file to call (if there's any problems), which he never did. Now DHL says the next delivery attempt will be made in 3 more days. My package is now 5 days past the date it was supposed to be delivered. I've never seen more incompetence or laziness in my life. How these drivers have jobs is beyond me! Good thing I paid a HUGE premium to have my package delivered faster... only to have a completely worthless driver NOT DELIVER it. DO NOT EVER ORDER ANYTHING IF IT'S SHIPPED THROUGH DHL. Clearly the company is nothing but scam artists that hire drivers that can't seem to speak english nor do their job properly.

The problem is they had to send it back to Morocco so they didn't even use the same tracking number to cover their mistake. They used a different one (return waybill **) and they even faked the delivery signature to show that it was delivered back to us in Morocco which never happened because they still have the package at their location in Meknes. They are calling us every day to come do the pickup so they can get rid of it and today we had a call from Casablanca center telling us that ""we will give you 140dh refund from the 542dh that we paid so we can close this case.""

But India was and is incompetent beyond belief, Thailand not helpful. Everyone at DHL passing things from pillar to post. At the time of sending from Thailand we were not informed of India KYC requirements. After no contact from DHL we called them and they email their requirement to upload docs, which we tried but the website failed to work over several days. They finally told me I could email it to them, so despite sending emails several times over on a daily basis to DHL employee copied in and calling them to ask if they received, they still did not deliver documents to customs on time. Plus KYC DHL kept changing per person in every step... It was infuriating and beyond incompetent. As I left the India to get to UK I still did not have my package. There was daily calls plus emails to DHL to different member within DHL office and no one gave a toss.Back to UK the tracing took an unusual step of taking the case on, although they kept asking for same info re-shipper redirect which was emailed to them over and over again. 20 days in the UK even finally someone with eyes and a brain could see the email that had the redirect from the shipper, it took 17 days for them to get there... And guess what, within the space of a day, on a Saturday, India, without communicating to the shipper or London, no mention of redirect even though it was sent in writing of the redirect, had sent the parcel back to Thailand. There is of course a proof of delivery document, but with no signature. Only the sender is no longer in Thailand so who was it delivered to? How does air mail and delivery to Chiang Mai via Bangkok, go through customs and get to the alleged shipper which all happens in less that 12 hours? When on the way out took 3 days just the Thailand part and especially when it's taken India weeks to process the same. Looks like daylight theft on many levels. Losing days of my life the phone with DHL everyday, chasing them, explaining over and over, and going nowhere for one month solid and going round in circles, it's like putting bamboo shoots under your nails... This is beyond appalling, it is traumatising! Do not use DHL if you need to send something important with trust they will honor you and your parcel.

Had I read what I've spent the past two hours reading about this company BEFORE placing my order I would have simply used a different vendor who DOESN'T ship via DHL! Monday 3/14 9:08 am EST I received a text msg from DHL stating my delivery would be ""Wed Mar 16, 2016 by End of Day and may require a signature."" A link was provided in the text msg to ""authorize delivery or choose another delivery option"". Following the link, I found that my ONLY available options were to a) change the delivery date or b) arrange to pick it up at their location. (Location NOT provided and, what the hell am I paying THEM for if I've got to go pick it up?) With no viable option available to me I rearranged my schedule for Wednesday and such a BROAD 'delivery window' (translation: I took the day OFF and lost a day's work/time & pay). I left a note on BOTH doors downstairs for the driver that I AM HOME - including my cell phone number AND, I made sure I was up and about by 8:30 am. On Wednesday March 16, 2016 at 9:50 am I received another text msg (they OBVIOUSLY have my phone number) stating that my shipment was scheduled for delivery TODAY by End of Day and may require a signature - just like before. No problem; I'm home - I'm ""up"" - I have notes on BOTH doors downstairs so all I need do is wait for my package to arrive. FAT CHANCE of THAT HAPPENING!! At precisely 12:01 pm EST I again received a text msg from DHL (they DEFINITELY know how to reach me when they WANT TO). This time stating, ""We were unable to deliver your DHL shipment today"" and to Contact Customer Service. I immediately rushed downstairs/outside to see if there had been a slip/note left stating they had tried to deliver my package. Guess What? No Attempted Delivery Notice. Within 2 minutes (no joke, REALLY - within 2 minutes) I was calling the Customer Service Number to inquire. Their recorded phone tree informed me that there was delivery address information needed and automatically put me on Hold for several minutes. Enter ""Janet"" at extn ** who informed me that the delivery address was incorrect. It wasn't - I made her read the address to me and it was dead on accurate to the letter. She then told me that there would be no 2nd attempt to deliver that day - HOW far off could the damned truck be in 6-10 minutes? We ascertained that the driver failed to make ANY reasonable attempt to find my address and rather than call the depot, customer service or (heaven forbid) ME he simply entered that the address was incorrect into their so-called system. I requested they contact the driver and have him come back and deliver the package as promised since he never even came to the address or attempted to deliver. After waiting 2 hours for a return call that never came I called again (note: I made 3 attempts to reach ""Janet"" in the meantime to no avail). This time I got ""Toni"" who after just a few minutes realized I wasn't going to 'go away' bumped my call up to a supervisor named ""Matt"". After having to re-explain EVERYTHING to him he agreed to attempt to contact the driver and to try to arrange to have him complete the delivery per our 'contract'. He was going to call me back - anyone want to take the bet? He didn't. Waited until 5:00 pm (3 hours) and then called back AGAIN. (Note: Repeated calls to 'track my package' during this time were met with the repeated msg of ""delivery address information required"" indicating NO SYSTEM UPDATE throughout the day.) Enter ""Octavio"" - a seemingly earnest and well-spoken gentleman (supposedly another 'supervisor') who assured me he would communicate with the driver's depot and get back to me - he would be ""on"" until 9:00 pm and would call me back shortly. Waited again 2 1/2 hours (7:30 pm EST) and now, enter ""Liz"" - yet ANOTHER group supervisor who proceeded to tell me in so many words that the company, DHL doesn't have any direct communication with its drivers and basically has no idea of where they are or what they are doing throughout the day; this despite the fact that they have a designated delivery route. Any communication with the driver takes place through the depot's tablet system, not by phone and unless a driver calls back to the depot when he/she gets a notice there's nothing they can do. Pretty unbelievable in this day and age of computers, cell phones and instant communication - I certainly wouldn't have trucks and personnel out on the road with no way to monitor their location, progress and activity. This is where I finally 'lost it' - I've now lost the entire day, waited 12 hours for a delivery the driver never even attempted to make, waited for hours for return calls that were NEVER going to be made and spent a total of almost 3 hours on the phone explaining the entire fiasco over and over and OVER again to one ""supervisor"" after another. Final result: after just about having a stroke over the complete incompetence and lack of organization, communication and professionalism I have what I can only believe is an 'empty promise' that my package will be delivered tomorrow - which is actually now TODAY (it's now 3:48 am EST Thurs Mar 17, 2016) by 11:30 am. I told them the driver had best show up with flowers - they didn't think that was funny. I also told them that I wanted this incident escalated to an actual, formal complaint - but after reading over 200 reviews vilifying this company I can't say I expect to see it go anywhere. I will say this: if I ran a company where a driver was requested to ""call in"" to his depot and he ignored that request for over 7 hours he would absolutely be looking for different work the next day posthaste. God help these morons if my package doesn't come tomorrow because I WILL go over to their depot in Philadelphia and I promise it will NOT be ""pretty"". Stay tuned to your local stations - film at 11:00; unless it's being delivered by DHL who can go to HELL...

review-1448856,Verified Reviewer,"Here's a couple of great examples of how terrible DHL truly is. First, speed. I ordered a number of packages at the exact same time from three different distributors through Newegg.com. All packages had changed to ""shipped"" status within the same 12 hour period, and in fact, the one package which was being sent via DHL (a small 80mm fan you can drop in a bubble envelope), was one of the first to change to this status. Meanwhile, another package was inbound from Shanghai, China. Guess which package arrived at my home first? If you guessed the larger, more expensive package from China, you were right. Absolutely absurd that a package could take longer to get to my address from California than from China, especially since I used free shipping which quoted 8-15 day delivery from the international warehouse, and 5-7 day free shipping from the domestic warehouse.Now, reliability. I live in a town with a fairly unique name, Solsberry, Indiana. Somehow, on the last shipment I put through DHL, they managed to send it all the way to Horse Cave, Kentucky. On the bright side, I learned a hilarious story about a town with a cave in the middle of it, that had a sewer leak which caused the entire cave to smell of rancid feces and thus make the center of town unlivable for a number of years (thanks Wikipedia), but on the practical side of things, HOW do you manage to screw up so badly that you not only miss the state, but you sit on a package for another 4 days trying to figure out how to use the address that was written on the damn package? Did I get any compensation for their failure? Of course not, I didn't even get an email or a call that my package would be late. Nay, if I wasn't one of those people who checks my parcels at least once a day, I would have never known. What a depressingly terrible shipping firm.

The problem is that DHL underpays its employees, so they steal packages.

I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphone, which was in the hands of DHL. DHL never delivered the package and it is quite clear that their employee simply stole it, since it was supposedly delivered to a non-existent person with an obviously fake signature.

DHL needs to firstly make sure that all of their employees, supervisors and all, are on the same page as with the company! This incompetent supervisor told me that the driver has the right to leave it in the leasing office. Really?? When did the leasing office PAY for my package? And with it being over $100 in value?? I was told long before to simply just put a note on my door to leave instructions... which I believe was too hard for DHL driver to follow yesterday. You people say that the driver can leave MY package in the leasing office and then expect ME to check my computer throughout the day all day long and while waiting for your dumb driver to deliver it. As much money as I paid, they better make at least a FIRST ATTEMPT to my door!!! I do know that. Reading the DHL reviews help me to understand that it is not just me. I see why now.

After scouting for two days all possible locations and getting no parcel I had to lose two hours of paid work, next week, to catch that same driver. He was incredibly rude from the onset, accusing me to be stupid enough not to understand his note. Unwillingly he accompanied me to a nearby tabac shop, where I have been TWO times already, and only then, after he mentioned a mysterious person who stored my parcel in a mysterious place, my parcel was found.The driver, then, shouted that I have no doorbell, and it is all my fault (!) so I had to waste even more time teaching the DHL driver how to read names on the doorbells. Ultimately, I paid for priority delivery, I got my parcel FOUR days late, I ran like a fool all across my quarter, lost two hours pay, have been shouted at, blamed for all this and I had to show the DHL driver how to read.

review-1367349,Verified Reviewer,"I order almost all of my stuff online. A couple of months ago I ordered something from Walmart.com. Before this purchase I had never even heard of DHL. Usually my stuff is shipped either UPS, Fedex, or the good ol' USPS. Walmart provided a tracking link through the shipping confirmation email they sent me, but every time I tried to track it I got an error telling me that the number could not be found. I also tried to track it through DHL, and was told I had an invalid number. I shrugged it off figuring maybe somebody made a mistake. 2 weeks later the package finally arrived, long after I'd given up hope of ever getting it. Usually I order something, and it takes it about 3-5 days to get to me. At most a week. Well, over a week ago I ordered something on Ebay. When the seller provided a tracking number, and I saw that it was shipping DHL I was so upset. I couldn't see straight. I cannot express how much I hate this company. My package has been sitting in Raleigh, NC since just after midnight Thursday morning. So it's been there all of Thursday, all of Friday, I don't know if they ship on Saturday and Sunday, but as of today which is Monday it is still sitting there. Of course, that's according to Ebay. When I try to track the package through DHL I get told once again that the number can't be found. See now I know it's not a human error. Nobody made a mistake. DHL is just an incompetent waste of space. The package was supposed to be delivered today, but that obviously isn't going to happen. I swear if I could put this company out of business I would. I've been waiting over a week now, and the package only had to come to North Carolina from Pennsylvania. I have had countless items shipped to me from Pennsylvania, and previous to this the longest I ever had to wait was four days. DHL has no business delivering mail as they are the most incompetent shipping service out there. I will never, EVER, order another item without first confirming that it will not be shipping DHL. I don't care how much I have to pay. This is ridiculous, and I want to ensure that I don't contribute to any more money entering this company's pockets.

review-1357103,Verified Reviewer,"As an experienced customer that has shipped nearly 500 packages in recent years through other services I'd like to report a couple of very bad experiences with DHL. I asked around and did some research online and discovered that my experience with them (which I will describe shortly) was the norm rather than the exception, at least here in Israel. I usually use Airmail or USPS Priority to my satisfaction. I have yet to lose a package. They arrive on time and the customs release process is straightforward. For the rare occasions when extra documentation is required (original invoice) customs sends a notification in the mail and you can them the extra documentation by fax or email. No extra fees beyond state taxes.This is not at all the case with DHL. A couple of weeks ago I noticed that DHL quoted 2-3 days for delivery and modestly lower shipping rate than USPS Priority. I decided to give them a shot. Instead of good service at a good price I walked right into a trap. First off, regarding the actual delivery time: 2-3 weeks vs 2-3 days quoted. It took 2 weeks for the first package to arrive. I'm still waiting for the second package I sent a day later, which I expect to arrive next week. By then 3 weeks will have passed. Then there were the extra hidden fees. It turns out you basically pay DHL to hold your packages hostage. They ended up extorting over 100% of the original shipping quote in compulsory hidden extra fees for: storage fees - airport/unloading services - compulsory ""help"" with various bureaucratic forms (health permit) that are usually not required - fee for paying customs taxes - fee for credit on customs taxes - etc, etc.Oh, and they claimed to be giving me a big discount on all of these goodies because I was a private customer. If this was a business delivery they would extort even higher hidden extra fees. I still ended up paying hundreds of dollars extra for slow delivery. Of course they won't be getting any more of my business but I wouldn't have fallen into this trap in the first place if vendors didn't allow them to advertise deceptive predatory pricing and bogus delivery estimates on the site in the first place.FWIW, it turns out that DHL doesn't always resort to these dirty tactics. Amazon international shipments sometimes end up going through DHL and they've never tried these stunts with me when shipping for Amazon. With customers of other commerce sites it seems they figured they could get away with it. While they continue dirty business tactics, the best course of action would be to remove them as a shipment option to Israel altogether. Failing that, vendors should at least protect their customers by correcting the information imbalance regarding both delivery times and warning customers of impending hidden fees.

review-1342457,Verified Reviewer,"DHL Athens is handling my shipment of two boxes from Marrakesh, Morocco to Paros, Greece. The shipping cost was $625. The boxes, for the construction of which DHL charged me another $100, contain typical handicrafts that I bought at various Moroccan bazaars for my own use. I paid approximately $300 for them, but was not informed by DHL Marrakesh that European customs officials would require the sort of itemized, official receipts that are never given in Moroccan or Turkish bazaars. The receipts that I supplied were apparently ignored by Greek customs, which more than doubled the declared value to 600 and charged 200 duty - two thirds of the value in other words. Apparently there is no way to reach these officials or to protest the charge. DHL Athens also dunned me a further 50 - a 'discount', they claim - for clearance of the two boxes. The whole adventure has thus cost me almost $1000, not including the cost of the items shipped, which were bulky but not heavy. It remains to be seen if the boxes, which have been en route for about two weeks, will reach Paros in good shape. I was told of course that the shipment would cost $725, which I find outrageous, but I blame the company for not at least warning me about the additional costs I would incur, including duty. And one final point: the DHL woman who dealt with me at the Athens office found my predicament very amusing on the phone. 'I've seen this happen before,' she laughed. 'Our private clients buy things at bazaars in Turkey, ship them home because they don't have room in their suitcases, and then are shocked by the big customs bill.' Live and learn, I guess.

I have only had 3 experiences with them, but 2 of the 3 have been very poor. The first one they had a package that I paid extra to have delivered within 2 days. It took them 5 days and they refused to refund the shipping charges, stating that they would only speak with the actual shipper. I understand that, but they also know that the shipper doesn't really care because they already got their money (especially when dealing with overseas companies).The second one was ok but the third one they showed was on their truck for delivery to me on the date it was supposed to be there. I waited until 10pm since the website was still showing that it was expected to be delivered that day. It didn't arrive. So, I called customer service and they informed me that the driver was too busy to deliver it when scheduled and they weren't sure when it would be scheduled again. They recommended I call back in to the local DHL after 9am for a status. So, I waited until 9am and called and let the phone ring at least 15 times until it automatically disconnected me.

review-1256027,Verified Reviewer,"I sent a laptop to my son who is studying in Tajikistan on 11/9/15. When making out the freight label, it indicated it will be delivered 11/16/2015. The package was picked up by DHL on 11/9/2015, but was sitting in Cincinnati till 11/12/2015. I called DHL on 11/16/15 and was told it was held up in customs at Heathrow. There were no update on the status whatsoever and was still showing last scan at Cincinnati. After daily calls to their customer service and finally was told that it was released Wednesday 11/18/2015. The package finally reached the destination 11/23/2015, a full week behind what I was told when preparing the shipment.When putting in claims to DHL, the explanation was customs delay, which is out of their control. My question is, why it went through customs at Heathrow? I thought package only goes through custom at the final destination? Why it took a whole week to reach Heathrow? It is so convenient to cover any error on their part by blaming customs delay, but is it?

review-1225044,Verified Reviewer,"Ordered a handbag from Shopbop.com that was sent by DHL. The handbag cost NZD $360 (which was well under the $400 threshold before tax had be paid). The bag was freight-free as it was over a certain amount. Therefore DHL had to estimate postage and this amount together with the cost of the bag would have to be under $400 to be tax-free. So DHL decided to ""estimate"" the postage so that it brought the bag's value to $400.36, a whole 37 cents over the threshold!!! This not only incurred tax and also nearly $60 of handling and administration fee payable to DHL!!! What a way to get some extra cash for DHL!!!I rang and spoke to several people, including Max, Maria, Jennifer, and Colleen. None of the staff were helpful and could not see what was wrong with the situation. Some were even rude and impatient or just did not know what was going on. I ended up returning the bag to sender as I was not prepared to pay $60 tax and another $60 to DHL all for nothing! This was the most unpleasant experience and I would not wish it on anyone!

However, with DHL I am obligated to pay 23.30 for it; and they only take debit or credit. And on top of this, the delivery girl set it up on the system so that my package cannot be re-delivered the next day for some reason without my permission.So now I have to spend an hour on public transit to the other side of my town to spend my money on taxes and bus fare to pick up a package that is barely worth anything. What really bothers me is that I wasn't informed that I'd have to pay before I claimed it, if I had been, I would have been prepared. These things over lead me to think that dhl is a bit on the sketchy side; why have I not experienced this extra fee crap with other companies sending me my items from the EXACT same locations?

review-1173129,Verified Reviewer,"So the two packages were separate waybill numbers to begin with, one was due on Monday and the other on Tuesday. On Monday I was very excited to receive my watch, so I could have a double whammy, one watch today and another tomorrow. When I got home the mailbox was empty and there was a message on my voicemail saying they tried to deliver it but I wasn't home and they gave me the waybill number for the package due on Tuesday, I knew then instantly that they lumped both watches together and I'd get them today on Tuesday, making one watch late. This irritated me but I was OK. So I took a long time and figured out how to go to the URL and there was no option to choose today for delivery for the waybill they gave me. When I called the woman was REALLY rude and said it wasn't confusing that the computer gave me a waybill number for a different package than it was referring to because when I gave her the waybill number emailed to me for the one to be delivered on Monday, she said that it was not confusing and my packages were not lumped together and they don't package them. So I tried explaining to her over and over again that DHL noticed they were both going to the same location so they are on the same truck and that is all I meant and that the machine provided the waybill number for the Tuesday package and the driver wrote the information on the Monday waybill to not look too late.

review-1159350,,"I will try to keep this as brief as possible but my experience with DHL has been a proper saga. It has happened many times, including today, that I will check my online tracking for a package and see that it is out for delivery. If it is ever actually attempted to be delivered, is more or less like flipping a coin. Just today, I have a package that has been put on the truck for the past three days only to find out that this afternoon, it was sent to a local pickup point. I don't own a car so picking up this package is going to be tricky considering it won't fit on my bike. I will also have to wait for a pickup slip to be mailed to me before I can even go and receive it. This exact same scenario has happened to me at least 10 times over the past year.In another case, I wanted to try and make it easy by just having it sent straight to the pickup office so that I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore. That was a huge mistake. In the guidelines, it was stated that I could use the pickup office as my delivery address and, with either the member Goldcard OR my government ID, I could pick up my packages. I went to the office and they said I could only pick them up with both, so they refused me my own packages. Obviously, I called DHL's main office about this, they confirmed that I only needed the card or my ID as stated in their guidelines. However, they never contacted this pickup office's manager to let him know this as he was still working from old guidelines that stated you did need both the Goldcard and ID.To make this short, the office sent my items back the same day (without ever trying to contact any main DHL office themselves as I requested they do while I was there) and I was saddled with paying shipping twice. DHL itself said it would contact me within a week and it's been months with no phone call. I will keep calling though, I want to be reimbursed.

review-1147521,Verified Buyer,"My overseas suppliers seem to think DHL is the bee's knees but my experience importing into the USA tells a different story. They're good when things go correctly but they are exceptionally lazy for a USA based express courier. We expect a certain level of reliability and effort from our carriers here, FedEx and UPS, and even the USPS. But DHL, although they try to be on par with the former two, just don't have the infrastructure or company culture to do the job very well. Partial deliveries are the norm when I ship import with DHL. My shipments contain a minimum of 3 cartons a piece and often quite a bit more but almost the majority of times, not all the pieces arrive together. Take today for example, I have three cartons delivering in Miami and 5 cartons delivering in Chicago. 2 of the 3 in Miami are out for delivery and 4 of the 5 are out for delivery in Chicago. In Chicago, although they all arrived in Cincinnati from China all together, they didn't leave for Chicago all together. 4 arrived in their Franklin Park, IL terminal on Saturday and 1 didn't even depart until Monday, this morning.In Miami, their phone agent just told me that the airplane container in which the remaining one piece was loaded from Cincinnati arrived last night but still hasn't even been broken down (meaning they haven't removed the packages yet to process them)... and won't get broken down at any point today. It will likely be done overnight and the package delivered tomorrow. The problem here, of course, is that these are traveling with someone to Venezuela tomorrow morning on a 9am flight. It is frustrating to know that the shipment is currently in Miami but because they didn't have enough manpower or resources in Miami to do the job correctly, they aren't able to get it out for delivery to my customer who needs it today. So, way to screw up both shipments delivering today. I have another shipment delivering to Hawaii tomorrow - one piece, so hopefully, they don't screw that one up.It's getting frustrating dealing with DHL's broken infrastructure here in the USA. I know they want to be a major player here but they have a long way to go before they get there. Thankfully, I have UPS as an option as well and FedEx on a much more limited basis (because of negotiated pricing) so most of my shipments may start getting passed onto them moving forward. I think I am close to being at my wit's end with DHL.

What wasn't impressive was the damage done to the travel case. Both front corners were busted up, the left being so busted and pushed into the case that the light in that section was almost not able to be removed. The left side panel was also left with a very deep scratch that went almost through the entire surface of the plywood and was 12 inches long. The lights inside survived but the case was a mess.The case cost me $75 from China and it cost me $340 to ship the entire unit with DHL. I filed a damage claim with DHL in the US. I didn't hear from them for a couple of days so I contacted them. I was told that the pictures I had uploaded did not make it into their system. So, I re-uploaded all of the pictures of the damage. A week later I received a letter from DHL that my claim was denied and that the claim needed to be placed by the shipper. I contacted the company I purchased the lights from in China and they too filed a claim with DHL including all of the damage photos I sent to them. A week later they too received a claim denial stating that they were not responsible for the damage or for the repair/replacement to the item. I contacted DHL again to find out why they would not take responsibility for the damage and was told that DHL Germany was the one that paid for the shipment and so it was up to the shipper to refund or replace my case and then they needed to file claim with DHL Germany. Then yesterday I received an invoice from DHL US for an additional $40 to pay for customs fees. Talk about adding insult to injury. Sure I understand having to pay duty costs and made the payment within 15 minutes of receiving the letter. I wasn't aware that this charge would be coming nor that DHL was automatically paying the $29 duty and changing me $11 to act on my behalf. Wish I would have been told about this by either the shipper or DHL. I was informed at the time I called to pay for the duty that my shipment came from Denmark, not Germany. I think if I called DHL again it may be somewhere else.... The story changes each time I contact them. DHL appears to have quite the elaborate system in order to take advantage. I'm left with a busted up travel case and DHL won't take responsibility to repair or replace it. I haven't been able to use it since the day I received it. One light cannot be inserted into its slot without much force (don't want to break the light fixture) and the case is no longer level because of the damaged left corner. I'm shipping it to a repair facility in the US and have it made whole. I personally will not ship with DHL in the future.

review-1117673,Verified Reviewer,"I purchased an item from Italy and was expecting it in Canada within 2-4 business days. I paid $45 CAD for the DHL shipping. Not $20, not $30, but $45. On the third day I called DHL to make sure they had my buzzer code, which could not be added to my shipping request online, but only by phone. At 9:00 am the item had left the warehouse for delivery. At 10:00 am I called DHL again to make sure they had all the information needed for the delivery, including the buzzer code. They told me everything was fine. I also asked DHL (both on the phone and online) to drop off the package without a signature.At 4:00 pm, after not receiving my package, I called DHL again and they told me that they had a wrong information concerning my address, AND that the buzzer code was missing!! This was after 4 phone calls with DHL, where I had (1) confirmed my address and (2) asked if they had passed on the buzzer code to the driver. Up until then, in all previous 4 calls DHL told me that everything was fine! I am flabbergasted by their lack of professionalism. I ended up with no package. I am leaving the country tomorrow and basically after paying $45 for shipping (plus $300 for the item and $75 of duties and taxes), I am left with nothing. Nothing.Bottom line: the drivers are unwilling, the company is unprofessional (one person told me that it was my fault, that I should have been more specific - even after 5 phone calls!!) and the representatives are untruthful. Two different people assured me that my package would be delivered (on a second attempt) by the end of the day. It is 9:38 pm and there is no sign of my package. They are basically liars. Go for FedEx. Or regular post office. Seriously. DHL sucks!

It is Friday and that only leaves 2 business days to find it and I do not believe in a month of blue Sundays that they will locate it.

Senders will make errors and if you do not have an efficient method of dealing with it, your shipments will stall as mine did. The address is or type is corrected and they have lost it.Last year it took over a month for a shipment from Australia. Again it did not arrive in time for a presentation, one that I had to fly to another province. Complained over several weeks, took forever and for too much energy. And no resolve. They were so horribly incompetent; it took forever to be processed just to get to the process of clearing customs. They didn't know how to clear the product through customs, had to ask me, sent the paperwork to the wrong person twice, then didn't send all the paperwork. Finally UPS had to step in and contact them to sort it the customs. Still took another week after I paid UPS my duties etc and cleared the wine. The wine arrived on the continent in 3 days and took 4 weeks for DHL to process it. Horrendous, I cringe when I find out a supplier is using DHL.

review-1031395,,"I was supposed to receive a packet yesterday which had a wedding dress that was to be worn last night. I was home all day for the packet and kept on calling DHL every few hours as the tracking online showed ""with delivery carrier"". I last tracked the packet at around 5pm and it showed ""Delivery Attempt, recipient not home"". I got very upset as I was at home all day waiting to accept the delivery. I am lucky because I live in a guard gated community and non-resident vehicles coming in have to register with the guard, I check with the guard on duty and he said from looking at the records no DHL vehicle has entered the premises. I called customer service and spoke with the supervisor and all he could do was say there is nothing they can do and the delivery will be made the next day.Today the same driver came to deliver my package and on me asking him why he did not deliver yesterday. His response was they had a very super busy day and he already spoke with his boss and everything is GOOD. I asked him the name of his boss and he said ""actually my boss is on vacation till Wednesday"" and that he spoke with someone else (name withheld). As a customer I don't understand what does it mean that it's all good? It is hard to believe that DHL drivers will actually LIE about making delivery attempts and get away with it by saying it's all good. I am sure that the Station the driver works for is very well aware of these lies and it is something that the drivers are trained to do when the day is super busy for them. I am lucky because I live in a guard gated community and all vehicles coming in need to be registered with the guard and that is how I was able to confirm that no one had come to make delivery. It has happened to my mom in the past few times, but because they don't live in a gated community we had no way to prove ourselves. Am sorry to say but DHL your needs to stop falsifying your notes.

review-1017773,Verified Reviewer,"I'm an enthusiast computer builder. I've ordered a lot of components from a lot of different sites. Every once in a while, I'll get a shipping confirmation from one of said sites. ""Sent with DHL Shipping"" I see those words and my soul dies. I try to wish upon a star that it weren't true, but I know deep down inside that I can't do anything about it. I curl up into a ball in the corner and weep tears of sorrow because I now know that, even though I chose (and payed for) 2-day shipping, it will not happen. Sadness turns to anger. I curse so loudly that I feel my neighbors may come complain to me at any second. I wonder in awe how any company could do business with DHL in with a clear conscious. But alas, there's nothing I can do. So I wait. I look at that sad email in my inbox day after day, tracking a package that doesn't seem to move. Finally, 5 days after that fateful click on ""2-day Express Shipping"", the tracking information updates. My package is in a sorting facility in a nearby town. This town is less than a 40-minute drive from my house. I can almost feel that cardboard box in my palms. I exclaim with joy, foolishly believing that my wait was almost over. The next day comes, I wait for my package to no avail. More days come, more days go. Am I stuck in a glitch in the Matrix? What is life? What is distance? Will Ashton Kutcher pop out of my closet to tell me I'm being Punk'd? I ponder these things while also pondering how, under ANY circumstance, a package could take 4 days to travel ~35 minutes. I'm sitting at home, contemplating what I want to say to the unfortunate, lazy soul who eventually brings me my package. Then, it happens. I hear a loud *THUD* on my doorstep, and a knock on my door. ""Tell me you DID NOT just DROP my new COMPUTER MONITOR on my concrete porch!"" I race to the entry way and swing open the door ready to verbally abuse whoever happened to be standing there. There's nobody. Just the back of a DHL delivery driver jogging back to his truck. I shout after him, but he ignores me. I try to walk up to his truck, but he speeds off. I bring my monitor inside, caressing its cardboard box, whispering to it that I'd kill that man if it was damaged from his incompetency of dropping something clearly labeled ""FRAGILE: COMPUTER MONITOR"" on the concrete. I weep tears of joy when I find it to be in working condition. But then, I start thinking. What if I hadn't been home? I would just have this big box, with what is obviously an expensive product inside, just sitting on my porch at my apartment complex. It could have so easily been stolen. I try to call customer service to complain, but I get sent to hold until I ultimately just get hung up on. I just stop trying, and live with how DHL has acted like everyone else does. This is a completely factual occurrence that has now happened TWICE to me, because of DHL. I hope that they go out of business, because they certainly don't deserve to be IN business. Possibly the worst transaction that I've experienced in my entire life. Die, DHL. Die.

review-1016635,Verified Reviewer,"First delivery mysterious did not happen as two person was waiting for the parcel in the flat all day long but no buzzer or any sign of delivery but their system said ""recipient not home""! No note, no evidence whatsoever. Called next morning after 7:30am, was advised to wait for return call later about the ETA after the depot opens. Obviously how little I knew it didn't matter even though my number was taken nobody called!I called DHL after 12:00 and the advisor gave me a standard update and the fact that DHL has no policy to leave any note for block of flats. Saying the parcel should be delivered within working hours until 6pm. This could not explain why the parcel was claimed to be delivered 7:29pm yesterday. Listening to the ""reasoning"" beyond my comprehension, I requested to talk to supervisor who eventually promised to look into the issue with the driver yesterday, the communication of the advisor in the morning and the parcel should be delivered ""no later than 2:30"" and my home number was taken. It seemed there was a plan.Of course I had to call back after 3pm, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this. This time, there was no previous call log or any record for the advice I was given early afternoon according to DHL. I was told that ""the driver was running behind, and he is not able to make the delivery in the next two hours!"" This would total at least three hours wait for nothing. The delivery wouldn't make it at least after 5:30 and I was completely lost the plot. By the time I finished with the call, it was 3:25 which meant I have pretty much lost another day. I was told the Manager ** will call me back in 10 min. Yeah right! No call again.I called again. No sign of the parcel and the manager said the parcel could be delivered during the day whenever it would be. Such conflicting information in relationship to the delivery time mentioned during the phone call at noon. The manager has also admitted that she had no influence over the driver nor the way they organised delivery. All she was doing just ""updating me"". She even offered me compensation but there is no compensation to lost time! This is how DHL handle their services. Though she said the parcel should be with me by 5:30pm and promised monitoring the delivery if anything happened.I called at 18:00 again. The person answered the call has had no knowledge of the case and trying to give me generic update again like the conversation at noon. After explaining the case again and a few moment later I was talking to another manager Ms. ** this time. I had to repeat the case again in order to get some attention, obviously. I was told the driver is finally in the area and was passed onto the driver ** 20 minutes later. The driver actually cannot find my address as I thought that they are professional and not sure what kind of GPS they have been using! The most amazing part was that the driver ** did not have my phone number which I have given to various managers and supervisors several times today including my home number. I was told DHL was giving the contact info. to the driver in case of for more direct and necessary communication.After I gave detail instruction about direction for the address and it still took another 20 min for the driver to get to my address let alone the final confusion for me to open the main building door 3 times and eventually went downstairs to receive the parcel! I expected creditable professional services from DHL who is supposed to be one of the leading players in the industry and who is supposed to have specific knowledge how to handle timely delivery as they often claimed in their commercials. I believe it is a lot to ask for someone to spare two working days for a parcel delivery compensating the lack of organisations, conflicting information, deceiving promises, and poor qualities in services delivery. It is a shame to all their contract sponsors including Manchester United and Formula 1! It is a reputation too rotten to be affiliated with in my opinion.

When we called he would not answer the call. We had to use our friend's phone to catch him. Finally on Friday 7.00 pm (we had left a message that we will not give up). He finally answered - traced our address destination details etc. but no AWB number - Bizarre. By this time the letter should have reached the destination Abu Dhabi. But it has not been received.

review-985678,Verified Reviewer,"I ended up not having to drive to DHL to pick up my package. The driver came back and dropped it off later in the afternoon. I should note, I spoke to two different customer service reps and a manager and they all told me that was not an option and there was no way to reach the driver and that it was against company policy for him to turn around (I called 15 minutes after I saw the package was not delivered even though I had asked per DHL's instructions that it be left at my door).I added a star since the driver returned and dropped off the package that day. However I feel strongly that my situation was poorly handled by the company. Yes, my door is not the most secure place to leave packages but why give consumers the option to ask that a package be left at our doors and then tell us their couriers can also decide whether or not they feel our doors are secure enough? They have no idea what it is they are delivering or whether or not customers made arrangements for the package once it arrived. Instead of running home for lunch like I'd planned, I ended up spending my lunch on the phone with customer service asking why the courier did not leave the package as I requested per their instructions. I am still baffled as to why they thought it made more sense for me to go out of my way to correct their mistake instead of asking their courier to.Original review: May 15, 2015I have been waiting for a package delivered by DHL. I paid for expedited shipping from China. To my delight the package arrived yesterday. However because no one was there to accept, they did not leave the package. That was understandable. I called DHL to ask what I could do. The very nice customer service representative told me they would come back the next day and if I wanted them to leave the package, I would have to leave a note asking they leave it, write the package number on the note and make sure I signed it. I was happy with that. This morning I did exactly as I was instructed. In facet, DHL had left a little ""Sorry we missed you..."" note on my door. On the note there was an area for you to sign your name and check a box to say you would like them to leave the package at the door. That was nice and I did just that then taped the sign to the door to protect it from being blown away.Well, the delivery person came again, attempted delivery and did not leave the package. I called customer service within 15 minutes of that attempt and asked if they could ask him to please turn around and leave the package as instructed. I was told that it was impossible as the drivers were on a tight schedule and they would make sure to do that on Monday. MONDAY. What was the point in paying for expedited delivery then? They need a disclosure that says ""Oh hey, if our drivers mess up, our bad. But we'll get you your package, just you know... late and not on time like we said we would"".Customer service even implied that perhaps the note flew away. Lucky for me I had a rep from our electric company waiting outside my unit building (I live in a unit with separate entrances and my entrance is not gated) who happened to call me because he was unable to get into our building (obviously my name and number are on the account). I was desperate for answers so I asked the electrician to check to see if the sign was still on my door. Not only did he confirm it, he witnessed DHL attempt delivery of my package. He said the sign was there the entire time.I spoke to management who then gave me two options. I can wait until Monday and they will deliver to my work place if it's more convenient (it's not), never mind the fact that I paid for expedited delivery because I need it before Monday OR I can drive to their facility, 40 minutes away from me, and pick it up. SO BASICALLY INSTEAD OF HAVING MY PACKAGE DELIVERED TO ME LIKE I PAID THEM TO, I HAVE TO GET IN MY CAR AND DRIVE OVER AN HOUR OUT OF MY WAY TO PICK UP MY PACKAGE. That I paid. To have delivered. To me. Why yes. Yes I am angry.

review-977521,,"Ok, it was January 2015 when I moved to UK and shortly after realized that I had left my laptop charger in my home country Venezuela (South America). Soon after I called my dad asking him if he could send it to me through DHL as it would be cheaper than to buy a new one, he went to DHL in Venezuela with my charger. A couple of books I left home, he asked to pay for everything so that I wouldn't have to pay for anything. Here in the UK, they told him that it was fine and I wouldn't have to pay for anything. The morning of February 10th I received a note in the mail from DHL saying that I needed to pay 14 pounds in order to receive my package so I decided to buy a new charger as it would cost me about the same. A couple of weeks later I got a letter saying that if I didn't pay 24,11 pounds they were going to take legal measures, so at the end I had to pay a lot more for nothing, thanks to DHL. The lesson here is don't trust DHL. They'll tell you one thing and then change whatever they said before. #not_a_DHL_customer_anymore.

Such a TERRIBLE experience I am still currently dealing with. DHL is fast at shipping your stuff to the wrong place, and throwing you in circles trying to find where it would be. This is what happened; April 24, 2015 at 230 is when online it said my package was approved by signature on the delivery date. No one came that day at all, I know because I had my mom there waiting on it for me. With further investigation they said that there was an error put in, it wasn't approved by me, but by the sender to leave it with no signature, (I bought stuff from this website before and they never did that with any other shipping methods) yet they asked for one via text message the day before delivery, or a note with tracking info and signature. I never replied, followed the link, or left a note. I finally follow the link Sunday, (April 26th, 2015) 2 days later having never received the package. Thinking that they may of kept it in the office and it would be out for delivery that upcoming Monday. To my surprise they had already made the delivery to ""my house"". IT NEVER CAME! So Recap; DHL said they got my signature on delivery, then changed the story to cover themselves. Now on April 27 they called leaving a message saying they will not call me back about this anymore, that the problem now lies with the sender and to contact them. I dislike DHL services with a passion. I experimented with them so I could get these gifts for 2 April birthday friends, that will now never receive their gifts. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this terrible business. If anything else can be done that I am unaware, please let me know!

review-975747,Verified Reviewer,"DHL doesn't even deserve the star they received. I received a door notification April 29th that they had attempted delivery of my package around 12:50pm, I also received my email notification and noted that a call was missed from my apartments buzzer system. The card left at the door said they would attempt the next business day which worked well for me since I was off work. I did have errands to run but I figured I would have enough time in the afternoon to complete them after I received my package. I received my email notification that my package was with the driver at 10:08 am (earlier than the day before) so I waited for my delivery 1 pm rolled around, then 2 and then 3. My front window gives me a very clear view of the street and I did not see a van pull up for the delivery. Around 320 pm I receive an email notification that they attempted delivery and I wasn't home and they would be holding my package for pick up in a city almost 2 hours away from me!! Obviously I was seeing red at this point, so I called their customer service. It was an utter PAIN to get an actual person on the phone. Once I finally did I told them what had happened and I got a very fake sorry. I obviously was not the nicest on the phone but judging by the reviews on this company I'm not the first one to lose their cool. She asked me after I repeated my address for her to confirm if the driver could walk right in or was there a buzzer... Seriously your driver buzzed it on the 29th so obviously there was one. And it's the same as my apartment number so it isn't that hard to understand. She was clearly trying to place the blame on me and not they. When I expressed my displeasure with having to spend another day waiting at home for a package she informed me I could call them after my email notification was received to find out a more specific time for delivery by contacting the driver for me. If you can contact the driver and find that out why couldn't you contact the driver for me right now and ask him to redeliver the package since he had left my residence not ten minutes before I was talking to her?! I wouldn't have wrote this review if she had of attempted to be a little bit understanding and helpful. And honestly I won't even trust the time they give me on Monday for delivery so I will most likely end up spending the whole day waiting for someone who is an idiot to deliver something I should have had close to a week before. I can't believe I paid shipping for this circus. USPS and Canada post work better than these people. I didn't think it was that hard to deliver a box to someone and be courteous to them over the phone.... So disappointed I'm going to have to stop buying from a company I love because of their shipping choice.

After 10 phone calls to DHL and 8 emails, they refused to charge me the correct rate of VAT for a product of €17.50.

review-968042,,"Firstly, here in South Africa, DHL refer to their customer service agents as rock stars. This is a big mistake as they are anything but. This rock star label creates high expectations from their customers and gives the customer service agents big egos. The reality is far from the portrayed image of an excellent courier service. Their staff are professional, uncommunicative, and surly. They operate within a system that is poorly designed for expedient shipping. If I don't contact them directly and start the ball rolling, the parcel will sit awaiting clearance indefinitely. I have to continually push them at every stage to have any hope of getting the parcel quickly.This differs from the experience many other couriers offer. My suppliers use a myriad of different couriers. Very often, a parcel of the same value and tariff to the DHL parcel arrive at the door 3 days after sending with no costly fees outstanding, or lengthy customs delays. I can wait up to 2 weeks for a DHL package. There are always delays in sending me invoice, clearing the goods and eventual delivery. They seem particularly poor in sending the first correspondence to get the ball rolling between themselves, the customer, and Customs. I have had enough and in future will contact all my suppliers, recommending them not to utilize the services of DHL.

In 3rd weeks I call them to know what's holding delivery. Then I was put on hold saying a specialist would connect with you. Next day I again called asking what's the issue. Then as I was given with couple of documents/form to update asking medication details, it's manufacture & doctor prescription. After filling all the medication details I thought now I would get it. Then again they came back saying they need SSN detail. After providing the SSN details then they turned up saying they need itemized detail of parcel that also in a day. Since this information was expecting this to be collected while making the shipment & what the items added by parents I was not certain to provide at very moment. Next day before I could send details - I was inform the parcel is shipped back to sender.. I was really pissed by this service.

review-934545,,"I ordered an electronic item from China few months ago. The item's value was & declared $30. I also paid $26 to the supplier for the DHL shipping cost from China. I received the item with a bill for 30 ($36) and I was stupid to pay it right away, thinking that perhaps the Chinese supplier didn't pay for the shipping cost. When I investigated this matter further, I discovered that the supplier had already paid for the shipping cost but the DHL decided to charge an extra 10 for administration cost and 20 for import charges based on the item valued 3 times higher. I had to send back the item after a week as it was faulty. I contacted the DHL in Dublin and they first asked me for proof of posting back the item to the supplier, which I did. Then they said that the proof of postage wasn't good enough (registered postage with the returned address + the content & weight) and after a month waiting, they never returned the charge nor responded to me. So, I contacted them again and they said that I had to contact the revenue. I have never used the DHL for sending an item, and since this experience, I will always make sure that NO supplier will send me any item by the DHL. They are ruthless, chancers, and cheats and overcharge people wherever they can. So the best thing for me as for many others with similar experiences is to boycott them.

The next day, I was told that a pick up from my residence can be arranged along with a lucrative discount deal. Booking code I received was ** and pickup was finalized for 23rd Feb 2015, 8:30 pm.

I didn't comply to his request and at 7:30 pm I received another call from DHL customer care (022 - 66822522: Abhishek:**) informing me that my booking expired as the packet wasn't ready at the scheduled time. I was subsequently issued a new booking no.** with the assurance that it will be picked in the next slot of 8:30 - 10 pm on 23rd February 2015 itself.While the assurance fell flat on its face, I was left stranded with my urgent packet. On calling the customer care again at 10:04 pm I was told in a very casual tone that nothing can be done now while DHL’s executive tried to sell company's ""express services"" to me (charges INR 4136 in my case) if I want my documents to reach in due time. The packet I have been struggling to send, with due thanks to DHL, may never reach by its deadline. Though, I will still try to send it even if I am required to pay more but I will ensure that I do not engage again DHL for the same and in fact any other courier needs in future.

When I said that I suspected it would not get there when expected and it may be best to take it back and save the high cost she told me that it was possible, because it was still in the US, and that I needed to decide if I really wanted this. I said I did and she told me that it would go to the same UPS store and that I would get my refund from them. There was no “it is not guaranteed”, or “it may not be possible”.Based on this conversation I made arrangements for the magazines to be shipped from London.December 18, 2014: The recipient informed me that they had received the magazines from London, and that they had also just received them from me. I could not believe what I was hearing and phoned Cindy again. At that point I could only leave voice mail for her and my calls were not returned. I called again and filed a complaint with a customer relations supervisor.

After calling to DHL, I figured out the address which supplier provided is incorrect or spelling mistake (i.e 2929 instead of 2920) so the DHL rep asked me for the correct address and he confirmed I will get my package tomorrow and today when I tried to track my package there was a message ""Please contact DHL"" then again I called DHL and they said package picked by custom so I have to contact custom and they can't give me any detail. When contacted the custom they just said they have the package and I should contact them after week or two or they will send me a letter after 30 days.So my question how come custom hold the item which already cleared by them and went out for the delivery a day back? The address I'm using always got the similar products all the time so no problem at address.

It went through several points in the US over 2 days and then said it was out for shipping to Canada. The next day I received a text from DHL saying there were customs fees of $26 I needed to pay before my package would be released. I paid it immediately. While I was on their site I checked off that they could leave my package at my front door without a signature because I wasn't sure if someone would be home. I happened to get home early that day and 2 hours after getting home, at 7 pm I received an email from DHL that my package was successfully delivered at 6:19 pm and it was left on my front porch. This was 3 days before Christmas. No package was there, no truck came to my house, my dogs did not make a peep which they usually go off when someone comes up to the door. I have been in dispute with DHL but they just say the driver says he left it at my house. The company I purchased the item from JJ's House says that DHL says they left it at my house.

I'm writing this review because I said so to DHL customer service. At contrary to DHL I hold my word... after reading review on the net I doubt that this will make any difference since they are already the worst company and should know this fact by now. Anyway here is my story:I bought a printer in Australia and paid $90 for EXPRESS delivery since I want my package for Christmas. Package was pick up on Dec 11th, get to Canada on 15th and then a custom agent ask for more information. Seems there was a problem with value and they need to contact me. The shipping company had not supplied my phone number on the way bill so DHL call them to get it and company has supplied it on 18th. It took 4 days before they ask for my info and then no one call me, instead the shipping company send me an Email stating that I’ve better call DHL. Which I did. I've corrected all my personal infos on their database and fill out the POA they ask me to do the same day. I still don't know why since no one ever call me to clarify the custom agent demand. I received a letter from DHL by regular mail on December 24th. A LETTER BY REGULAR MAIL TO ASK ME TO “CONTACT THEM”. What an EXPRESS SERVICE IT IS. I then call again to see what was happening and ask to speak to someone in authority. I was force to complain to get someone on the line. The lady send me 2 more form to fill which I did and then nothing happened to my package. I call again 3 days later and lady told me that an Email was sent on the 23rd that I have not respond... No mail ever left their computer - a fact that was confirmed later on. They charge me $70 for duty and $20 more for their fees which I was forced to pay if I want my package. We are now January 3rd 2015 and still no package. No one took the phone to call me. They always rely on mail which they take 2-3 to respond... That is EXPRESS behavior indeed! You are force to do all the call and no one care. They got your money and too bad for your package.I'm still waiting for my package. Nothing I can do. It's been 22 days for an EXPRESS DELIVERY and 90 USD for this kind of service. I call back and demand a complete refund which they only reimburse $20 fees and refused to take any responsibility. I’m still waiting for the refund to comes... Maybe in 10-15 years. IF you need a package delivered rapidly... or just delivered you better ask a brainless slug to delivered it. It will be by far better and faster than DHL Express for God sake.

The tracking of the shipment was easy to follow and I received personal up-to-date calls from Tanya whenever I had a question. I was very pleased with how the transaction was handled from start to finish. I also want to thank customs in Nigeria for the smooth process and release of goods once duty taxes were paid.The only recommendation I have is for customers to be able to access on-line the duty/taxes for specific items in advance. I was quoted 5% of the total value of the shipment and it actually was more than double which could have made a difference with respect to whether or not I would send the package. Overall, a special thank you to DHL and Nigeria custom's employees for all their efforts.

When it was originally sent to my home address, I missed the delivery and I signed the receipt and left it on my door for the carrier to just leave it there. The carrier never came back to see the receipt and he/she left another receipt in my lobby area, not bothering to come upstairs to see that I left further instructions for them to leave the package. I then called the DHL to make new arrangements. I was instructed by the customer service rep, on that is no problem, go on our site to change the location, and you will receive your pack tomorrow. I did just what I was instructed to do and there was no package. I called the following day and spoke to another rep who told me that there is no record of me re-routing the package. I confirmed to the rep that I received an email thanking me for using DHL In-Demand. The rep then gave me their customer email address and advised me to use that instead. The next day, there still was not package. I called again and was told that they received my email too late but don't worry, I will get my package in the morning...Needless to say, no package was ever sent out. I understand it is the holidays, but after 11 days of being lied to is extreme and disappointing. I spoke to several reps and was promised over and over that they would ship my package out to my new address in Manhattan. On the 10th day, I called up and I was hung up on by one of the reps when I asked to speak to someone in charge. I was left on hold for about a half hour. The biggest joke is that they have the nerve to have the song ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough to Keep Me from Getting to You"" playing while you're on hold. After getting nowhere with the reps, I decided to go to pick up my package in the Queens location. That was a bad move. It took me 2 and 1/2 hours plus a cab to get to this out-of-the-way disclosed location... I will never use DHL ever again and advise everyone else to just pay the extra money to have your packaged shipped through another parcel company.

Also they called me 2 times already (yesterday and the day before... yes 2 extra days delaying) just to ask me if the price of $59.40 is right!

I told them that this is what I've paid and they can check my Paypal transaction which I've sent them. The second time a DHL representative was bold enough to tell me ""and how do we know that this is not a partial payment?"" I mean?!?!?!?!?!

Plot twist, in a Greek forum someone said they try to make parcel to go through customs so they would ask extra for ""effort-time"" and if it costs less than 100 euros they ask 36 Euros else it's 50 euros (don't know if they have extra price for very high priced items).Also the DHL guy told me that even if this is a gift with actual value to me 0 Euros, I should find out the proper price so the Gov can charge me the ""appropriate"" vat and tax... and I'm like what???

review-871364,Verified Reviewer,"I ordered an item worth USD25.00 from China online, including a few cheaper items, making up a small package of no more than 1kg. The item was sold to me with free shipping. The item was shipped via DHL. On arrival I was charged a surprise $7.50 handling fee by the DHL Licensed Operator in my resident country of Belize. Furthermore, the DHL Operator, a private company, stamped on the Waybill a whopping shipping charge of $46.00. The commercial invoice attached to the Waybill showed a shipping charge of $5.50. I was told by the DHL Operator that Belize Customs requires they stamp the Waybill with the appropriate shipping charge for that part of the world (but they fail to realize that large international companies make deals with DHL and pay a fraction of what an individual might be charged for shipping a single package). Belize Customs then charges a percentage of both the value of the item and the shipping cost, because in their view the item's worth in Belize is both costs. True, had I known. However, I bought the item with FREE shipping, otherwise I would not have bought it. Also, on speaking with Customs, they told me that if I could get the DHL Belize Licensed Operator to stamp that it was free shipping, then I would not be charged for shipping. They refused. In all, I was being asked to pay duties to the sum of $130.00 for this $25 item. I refused to pay and it now sits in a DHL warehouse by the Belize International Airport. I have tried to contact DHL Head Office, and the department that issues licenses to foreign operators such as Belize, because I felt that they were probably unaware of the blatant disregard for standard policies and outright lying about the true cost of shipping. Can anyone HELP! Does DHL care? I know it is not a large amount, it is simply the outrageous nature of this DHL operator and the fact that there is no recourse I can find to sort this out. The item was a heart rate monitor for my wife, a health necessity, no less; an item we cannot buy in Belize so must be shipped in.

It took me two hours to complete this task but finally have my package at hand. The representative at the Franklin park location was kind and asked for the appropriate documentations to finalize the torture. After many days of phone contact with DHL, it was apparent that the personnel at the Franklin park location never took the time to confirmed that in fact the duty/tax fees were paid in full. Instead they opted to place a hold on package for delivery. What an incompetent location! Though I must say that the 800 number customer service is the one who figured the reason for the delay.

All goods returned on 18-Aug., this time, all the boxes had been opened and checked by DHL and our packages had DHL ""special alert"" label, bar code label, DHL yellow tape all over our eight boxes of shipment. I called their operation team. They told us that our label sizes and MSDS certificate attached are not correct, which was NEVER mentioned during the first return. They didn't clarify and indicate all information of the wrong packing at the 1st time return the goods.Our label clearly states that all eight boxes are same content. It is not necessary to open all my boxes if they found the label size and MSDS were incorrect and packages were to be returned again to the sender. Who's responsible if there is anything missing or damage? As the result, I spent a lot of time to re-pack all packages. Finally, I spent total 11 days on this shipment and all goods still at my office now.At this point, the receiver of our packages can't catch the event date to display the power bank for giveaway.

Afterwards I gave Ms. ** the Final Invoice that she needed along with each picture of all items included in the package so no one will get confused.

On May 27th 2014, I went to a local authorized DHL vendor (similar to fedex but for domestic and international) and shipped a package to India. The package contained 7 phones - 6 Iphones and 1 Samsung phone; along with 1 Ipod, and 1 toothbrush. I purchased insurance on the package as well. I was told the shipment would arrive in 5 business days. On the packaging slip, also known as the airway bill, I stated the value of the shipment at $2800.00. The cost of my shipment was $143.00 which included insurance for the package. The value of the shipment was also indicated on another form - PRO-FORMA INVOICE.The receiver of the package - Nizar **, my brother received a phone call from a local DHL office in Mumbai, India requiring him to travel to the state of Mumbai, India from Gujarat, India to sign documents in order to have the package released. According to google maps, the distance between the two locations are 425 miles. My brother reached out to us asking for guidance. We called the DHL office where my brother received the call from and I was told to provide 6 documents regarding the shipment. I explained to the representative that I was not told to provide this information on the day of shipping nor did the DHL corporate representative tell me that this was required both before and after the shipping of the package. The representative explained that the documents were necessary in order to have the package released.In the email that the DHL representative sent me, I see the documents that she requested along with my airway bill. What is strange is that my airway bill has the shipment value crossed out from 2800 and replaced with 2400. The DHL representative in India claims that my package is in a customs hold. We informed the representative the following day that I do not have all the information that she is requesting (serial numbers of phones, etc) and was not told that this would be required in order to deliver my package. We asked for our package to be sent back to us and they stated that someone has to pay to have the package released.When we asked about the process required to file the claim on the package that we bought insurance for, we were told that the only person allowed to claim insurance is the vendor whose account was used to send the package, not who made the actual payment. I was unaware that the retail representative used his DHL account to send my package, nor do I understand how their processes work. As a customer, all I am concerned with is my package reaching its final destination and if it can't be delivered or is not in the same condition in which I sent it, I would like to get reimbursed based on what the insurance that I bought.Lastly, in regards to the change of the package value, the DHL corporate representative agrees that the price was changed to not burden the retail representative with additional documents that would need to be furnished.

I asked specifically if it was in US, which they confirmed. Not only DID the express delivery not arrive on time at Christmas, it arrived almost 2 weeks later and in pieces.

On Monday DHL attempted to delivery to the Social Security Office at 7:04 PM. On Tuesday at 7:31 PM (at which time I asked via email why repeatedly attempt delivery to a government office after hours). On Wednesday no delivery was attempted at all. On Thursday the delivery was finally made at 12:55 PM (needless to say the delivery was too late by then).I complained, the least I could get was my money back since I spent $37 to insure that the parcel would arrive in a timely fashion instead of a $1 stamp and maybe had I sent it via regular mail it might have gotten there before actually did. I then received an email from DHS telling me I should go back to the UPS Store where I originally shipped the parcel and get my money back. I did so on February 1st and gave the employee all pertinent documents (including a copy of the email instructing me to go there to get my money back). I was then told that the check would be mailed to me. I also complained to the Better Business Bureau since I did not get the service I was promised. I then got a telephone call from one of their representatives. She asked for various things, including the receipt. I scanned these and sent it to her.Although what I wanted from DHL was the service I paid for, not really the money I spent for such, since that service was not provided I would like my money back. Today, three weeks after I followed the instructions on the email, I received from them and visited the UPS Store with my documentation, I still do not have my money back. Yesterday evening I received a call from the DHL representative in which she declared that the service I had used had ""no time constraints"" and she would ""try to see if I could get my money back"".

review-758822,Verified Reviewer,"For the past 3-4 years we have had our maintenance medicines shipped from the UK to the Philippines through DHL. Every single shipment, which is every 6 months, we encounter the same problem in getting our shipment released and delivered to our home. Every single time we are asked to provide the prescription list of our medicines (which is already inside the box) which they seem unable to locate each time. So then, we are charged a large customs fee and additional storage charges for the delay in the release of the package (which is entirely their fault for assuming that there is no list of medicine in the shipment when in reality there always is). So even though our shipment has already arrived they still hold it until we can prove it is indeed for our personal use. If they would only check our past records for the past 3-4 years - we have had the same medicines from the same shipper sent to the same addressee and have the same charge that we pay every time - if they would only get more organized in receiving and releasing the same old shipment, they will save time and the recipients will be less stressed in getting our medicines! Why they have not improved their system only shows that DHL is totally inefficient! For an international company known everywhere in the world, it is so disappointing to be the recipient of their incompetency. If they would only have better, more efficient, more helpful customer service personnel, and update their system of releasing shipments to customers, maybe they might make it in this competitive world of shippers. Otherwise, DHL is on its way to losing ground and collapsing.

When I spoke with customer service originally, they tried to blame it on customs.

Called DHL immediately and received many apologies. I told her that I was leaving town on Monday but she assured me that my package would be sent on Saturday, December 21st. I waited the entire day AGAIN and nothing. No status online. No attempts.I called DHL Monday morning and the representative told me that they only deliver packages to major cities on Saturdays and that Barrie isn't a major city (too bad the other DHL rep didn't know this). He also told me that the delivery was already out but that because I was last on Friday that I would probably be first on Monday's delivery. I decided to wait an extra hour before leaving town just in case. I left town at 2pm instead of 1 and the delivery was attempted at 3:15pm. I then called DHL again to let them know to ship the item to a new address in Sudbury which they told me they couldn't get it there until the 27th. I was fine with that even though it was a Christmas present.December 24th: the status of my package says ""in delivery"". I immediately contacted DHL since I was under the impression that the package wouldn't be sent to the Sudbury address until the 27th. DHL assured me that the package was in Sudbury and that I should receive it before 8pm. I waited at my brother's (skipping part of my grandparent's dinner) waiting for the package AGAIN only to get heavily disappointed AGAIN for the 3rd time.

review-737283,Verified Reviewer,"On a recent trip to India, we purchased 3 carpets which we arranged, through the shop, to be shipped home. After we returned home, we were notified that the shipment arrived in the country and required customs clearance. We provided credit card information to a DHL representative to clear the carpets on our behalf. A few days later, we checked the website to determine the status of our shipment and were surprised to see that DHL was indicating that they had been delivered and that no signature was required; BUT, we received nothing! We DHL over the course of 2 weeks and when we were able to connect with someone we were told that they were investigating and needed to talk with their driver. After a week and a half of chasing DHL, they told us they checked with their driver who claimed that he did make the delivery. We asked for some evidence that this was the case - a paper or electronic trail of the driver's routing that day, anything. To which we received an e-mail restating that they had indeed delivered the package and that they were now leaving it up to the shippers in India to resolve the situation i.e. they absolved themselves of any responsibility without providing some level of satisfaction that they had indeed actually made the delivery. I cannot believe a company in North America can behave the way that they have and still stay in business. The lack of any evidence and the way they brushed us off leads us to suspect that we are dealing with some sort of cover up and dishonest people working there from top to bottom. We sent e-mails to everyone in the chain of command including the Canadian president Greg Hewitt. Greg did not reply even though the DHL web site says ""GO STRAIGHT TO THE TOP"". What nerve - if you don't mean it then don't say it.Someone by the name of Gillian ** followed up and we were led to believe that this was a result of our e-mails to Greg and his office. But, she was virtually impossible to contact and when she did make contact, she merely told us that the driver said the package was delivered. No response was forthcoming from Gillian when we asked for some sort of proof that this really did happen.Before Gillian came on the scene, we were told our case was being handled by Rita ** in customer service. She too was impossible to reach and when contact was made, she was rude and uncooperative and for a week or more told us that she left a message with the driver who hadn't called back. After lodging a complaint the case was taken away from Rita and transferred to her team lead Lorenzo who, even though he made commitments to keep us informed daily, never did. In fact he just disappeared from the scene and took the day off. The entire ordeal has left a bad taste in our mouths and leaves us strongly suspecting someone at DHL as having stolen our goods and the rest of the organization covering up. I cannot believe that a Canadian company can operate in such a manner.If anyone out there knows of any other option that we might pursue, we would like to hear from you. We are amazed that as consumers we have no protection from an unscrupulous company like DHL. This company's real business is dealing in fraud. If this is not the case, then why were they so difficult to deal with? Why were they so unresponsive?

review-718053,Verified Reviewer,"I sent my first package through DHL this week. I will not be a repeat customer. My experience was nothing short of disastrous. I sent a shipment of gifts to a friend in Vietnam, parcel ID **. I purchased the service through a third-party reseller, who provided the shipping label and what I thought was a customs form. I entered into the form the contents of the package at a value of USD43.00. I noticed the form was titled ""Commercial Invoice,"" so when the DHL driver picked up the parcel, I expressed my concern and specified that the package contained only gifts and not a commercial shipment. He assured me that everything would be fine.When the package arrived in Vietnam, an exception was generated. I sent an email asking the status of the package and received a return call from a courteous English-speaking representative in Ho Chi Minh. She indicated that she needed contact information for the recipient; I gave her the recipient's e-mail address. I indicated that the recipient was not perfectly fluent in Vietnamese and asked if she could communicate with the office in English. The representative assured me that an English speaker would be available.The recipient forwarded me a copy of the email she had received, which asked her for details regarding the shipment which a gift recipient should not normally be expected to have access to. Still, I assisted her in filling out the form and she replied in English. We specified again that the shipment contained only gifts. A DHL representative next came to the recipient's address and gave her a copy of the ""commercial invoice"" which I had provided to DHL. The representative stated that the recipient would need to pay the USD43.00, the value of the items listed, to obtain the package. It should be noted that $43 is a significant hardship for the recipient due to the exchange rate. I messaged the DHL Vietnam website in English stating that the list was not meant to be an invoice, that the contents were gifts and not a commercial shipment, and that the recipient should not be invoiced. A family member of the recipient called the Ho Chi Minh office and was told that they have not received her email. It was sent again without reply, another call was made, and the representative indicated that the office could not read the English email. The recipient had her email translated into Vietnamese and resent it in both languages. Finally the Vietnam office confirmed receipt and advised the recipient that the package would take approximately two days to clear.Seeing that DHL had a policy of charging for packages taking over three days to clear, I contacted the U.S. office. I received a voice mail message back stating that the package had been cleared after all and would probably be sent when it was morning in Vietnam. The driver did deliver, charging the recipient's family the $43 which we had explained repeatedly should never have been invoiced. All told, the package spent twice as long in the Vietnam office as it did in transit, and the entire transaction was plagued with errors, poor communication, and a wrongful charge which represents a needless hardship to the receiver. I would like the full $43 refunded directly to the recipient as soon as possible.

review-659739,,"So I'm a student and ordered two textbooks for an online course I'm taking. I also live in an apartment building with a very reliable building manager. I went home for Christmas break letting her know I would be out of town until January 3rd when I get back. Every other shipping company left notes on my mail box/in box to pick up my packages from them but not DHL! I finally used the tracking number which claimed the books had been dropped off on December 26th. I called the support line and they did an investigation. Supposedly, my manager had let them into a secure mailroom. I talked to my manager which says Canada post is the only one who has access to that room for legal reasons, so I called DHL back up. Two weeks later, they got back to me (using the line no signature was required to hide behind) that it had been left outside my apartment door. So I went and talked to all my neighbors, all elderly, and none of them saw any package being left outside my door. So I contacted my case manager which took over 2 weeks for him to get back to me or pick up his phone. When he got around to leaving a message on my phone, the story was now that the two building managers at the two desks, a man and a woman, told them it would be okay to leave the package since I would be around and that I hadn't left for Christmas. There is only one desk and only a woman manager. They then informed me the case is closed and to contact the seller for a replacement. I went through PayPal since it was an eBay purchase but since they were able to provide a shipping number, I'm now out $120. It's been over 2 months fighting this and I don't know what other options I have left but with bills, I could really use a refund or my books. I can't afford to replace them which at this stage would be over $300.

In your case, it did not go well, so please contact us again tomorrow!"" Apparently in Russia, customers are there to double check the DHL computer data. My strong advice is, try another operator!

We called DHL, paid customs duties and taxes over the phone and asked that the package be left by the door on the next delivery day. We wrote the payment authorization number on the slip with a note that all was paid. The driver came, scribbled on the note that we must pay COD and did not leave the package - he did not even glance at what we wrote. So we called again and this time, we wrote a large size sign asking that the package be left by the door and to note the payment confirmation. No box on that day, or the next. The weekend came. On Monday, we called again and we were told the package was in the truck and would arrive by 8 pm the latest. We waited - no package again. So we called again and this time were told that the driver had come and nobody was there - which was a lie by the driver. This time, we were told the package was at the depot. We did not want to risk having the package returned to the sender by some crazy DHL mistake again, so we drove out to the depot to pick it up after expressly asking the phone DHL rep to keep it there for us. Again, many apologies and reassurances, but when we finally arrived at the depot which was 30 miles away from us, we were told the package had been delivered! We called home and it really was there, but we had driven all that way for nothing. On top of it all, the dispatcher said the driver had not had time the day before to drop it off which of course, proves that he lied about having come.I must say, it was an unpleasant experience of so much poor business practice and lack of coordination.

The distance from the head office to the destination is 4 kilometers.When I went to International Life House at 4pm, I was told that DHL forgot to deliver my parcel. They informed me to go pick it at their head office if I was in hurry, at my cost. DHL ought to know that we pay the premium rates because we believe they are efficient.

The parcel we were expecting to get arrived to Malta 4 days ago, and we still did not get it. It traveled all around Europe and made more than five thousand kilometers in two days, but it was not able to reach the last destination. However, it is not more than 15 kilometers from your office. How can it be explained?On Friday, 17th of March, we were told that a parcel would be delivered till 6 pm. After a long (3 days) weekend, we contacted your office, verified address, and were assured that it will be delivered on 20th of March. My cousin was at home all morning and day, waiting for a parcel as we were promised to receive it today. But again, it is postponed.Due to the unprofessional attitude and irresponsibility of DHL Malta, we had to celebrate our traditional holiday without its main attributes. Thank you for your time. I think that would be our last deal with DHL, being more expensive than other mail services. It is still cannot be relied on.

It was being sent airmail as apparently there was some reason it could not be shipped. We were charged approximately $250 for this. Five months later, we still have not received our parcels and are very upset as they contained many items we had bought during our trip, our personal belongings, and the cost of what was inside the parcels was quite a significant amount, $600-$700 at least, I believe. We now have no idea how we can trace these items, or what we can do to try and find out where our items have gone to. One of the smaller parcels (a tube containing posters/paintings) was somehow sent to my aunt’s address in the UK (we were told to put an address of somewhere in Europe we were staying) and she sent it on to us in Australia.

I called the DHL people in Saudi Arabia and they said that I have to have clearance from the Saudi customs for this package. So I went to Saudi customs and told them that, ""I have cigar package held in Bahrain and they will not send it to me until I get a letter of clearance from your office.""

And since it is up to Bahrain to decide what goes in Saudi Arabia, we are not giving you any clearance until you bring the package here in Saudi Arabia."" So I returned to the DHL people and told them what happened with the Saudi customs and they said to me, ""We are not sending the package to you until you get us the clearance. This is our rule.""

From Dec. 23 onwards, I called DHL office in Dammam many times to get an update about my shipment and yet, up to date, I have no idea what happened to my package. From Dec.23, the DHL call center assistants who attended my phone calls replied me with that my package is in Bahrain and it is being delayed to enter KSA due to huge amount of parcels and limited capacity of scanning at the Saudi border. They advised me to be patient for a couple of days since it will take some time.I waited and when I phoned again, I was told the same thing. When I requested to talk to a manager, I was never put through and was told that they will ask him to call me back! On Dec. 27 evening, a call center assistant informed me that since the shipment is delayed that much, he is going to open a trace file for my package and he is going to forward it to his supervisors. He informed that a tracing agent will call me on Thursday morning regarding my issue. I waited a long time for that call, but nobody called me. On Thursday afternoon, I called DHL and they informed that my case is handled by an agent and he has already gone on day off. I was surprised and disappointed that he or anyone else did not even make an effort to call me to update me with what is happening to my shipment. I tried to call in the following days and the answer was very much negative and all of the call center assistants advised me to contact the agent on a working day.When I called in a working day, he was not reachable at all and the answer I received was he is busy with another client and he will call you back as soon as possible. So I am still waiting. Last Sunday (1st of Jan. 2012), one officer introduced himself saying he is handling my case and he told me that they did a search in Bahrain where my package was last found according to tracking history and the results were negative and asked me to give 48 hours time to locate the package. On Jan. 2, I received a message from DHL on my mobile saying Customs status updated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. I called again today, but I was told that a new person is handling my issue and luckily, he answered my call but asked me to wait for another 48 hours.Later, when I asked him what the message I received means, he replied that he does not know anything about the massage. Of course, I did not like the answer nor to wait for another 48 hours and expressed that to him. Then he simply, very unprofessionally and in a threatening tone said ""Look Sir, you have to be patient otherwise I will declare your package as lost and we will compensate you with 100 USD regardless of the value of your package"". I do not think DHL want this to be the image and the message it conveys to its customers nor accepts that this is the service it will provide in exchange the decent fee.

The problem was that DHL pulled a fast one on the recipients by handing the packages over, no mention of fees, officially placing them into the category of having 'accepted' the package.

I called DHL and a person took the address of my office building in downtown and said that they will deliver the package tomorrow. On the next day, another person called and asked me what to do about my delivery. It seems like the person I talked to the night before, either did not enter my information or put in the wrong account. I gave the customer service representative (Elanie) my office address again, which is in downtown Toronto, and it's a high rise building on Wellington Street West. No delivery was made. I called on October 27th and talked to another customer service representative named Eva about my delivery. She mentioned that it was a bad address. I told her that this is where I am calling from now and it is a 28-storey building. I asked, ""How come your delivery person couldn't find it?"" I asked her to schedule the delivery anytime in 24 hours except from 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm, but she mentioned that she cannot guarantee the delivery time. I asked her to deliver that package/mail (they couldn't even tell if it is a mail or a package) outside my apartment or at the building lobby and I will be responsible for any loss or damage. She said that she cannot deliver it to that address since the delivery was attempted to that address. Even though I asked them not to go at 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm. At some point, she hung up the phone. I tried to talk to any of her supervisors but she said she doesn't have one (What a lie).I called their customer support again and spoke to a male representative (but I can't remember his name) and asked him to deliver it to my aunt's home, about a 45-minute drive from my home. He took all the information and confirmed that it will be delivered within 24-48 hours. I also mentioned that they can leave it outside if my aunt doesn't respond (since she is an aged person). He agreed.I received another call from Elanie today, October 28, 2011, and she was mentioning about the bad address. I told her about the conversation I had with someone yesterday and gave him the new delivery address. But she said she doesn't have any information about that. It seems like, the male agent again did not document anything about the delivery address that I gave. Anyway, I gave Elanie the address of my aunt. But she refused to deliver it outside without my note on the door. I asked her for a fax number so I can fax my authorization to leave outside the door. Then she transferred the phone to Sherrill. Sherrill mentioned that she is going to give that package to Loomis Express (their delivery partner) and I can pick it up from their location in Markham. She also refused to provide me their supervisor's or any manager's name. I hope I'll be able to find it at Loomis Express.I have used DHL at least 30 times in the USA/UK and Asia but I never had any problem. Here, the package is in Toronto and I am also in Toronto, not in a jungle or in a desert that's hard to locate. But DHL is making it so hard that they are trying to deliver the package to the moon. This is the worst service that I ever had in my lifetime. They also talk and work like a machine or a robot.

review-36532,,"I am about to relate a tale, a tale that revolves around the life of an artist, and a huge multinational transport giant.  In the first instance, the artist who resides in Spain arranged with his representing gallery in the USA to take part in an exhibition of his work.  The date for the exhibition Vernissage was to be 28th of May 2010, running until August 15th.  The artist now had a plan and a space in a gallery to show his new work.  Happily he left the US and returned to Europe.  This was in November of 2009.  At his studio on Ibiza, the artist set forth.  Over a period of 5 months, the artist produced 20 pieces of sculpture in a mix of media.  From this, he selected 20 together with the gallerist’s 13 pieces, which they agreed would be appropriate.  The pieces were wrapped and packed and sent with the huge multinational carrier, a company who the artist had worked with on several previous occasions. Upon arrival in Connecticut, the box was unpacked.  To the dismay of the gallerist, 9 of the 13 were broken.  And at least 3 were smashed to pieces.  None were fit to exhibit.  Time was short, and the show was cancelled.  The total resale value of these goods was in the region of $7000, not a great deal for so much effort.  But what we must not forget is the enormous potential this exhibition held for both the gallery and the artist.  The gallery was bringing back a British artist for the second time.  The artist was about to hold one of the most important shows of his career, his breakthrough into the American market.  The gallerist was of course very upset.  And for many reasons, a lot of money had been spent by the gallery on promotion of the event, photos, videos, catalogues, web, and real time art publications, plus all the invited guests who were travelling from across the corners of the US.  And because of the obvious bad feelings developed, the otherwise excellent relationship between the two was destroyed.  The artist, both powerless and frustrated at being so far away, after 5 months of spending energy, the cost of the materials, the international transport, and the fact that all of his creations were reduced to rubble, was forced to lick his wounds.  He thanked heaven that he had used a reputable company, a company with years of experience, and one that would be shocked, horrified, and angry to find that their staff treated their client’s belongings in such a shoddy way.  We are not talking about an accidental droppage or an unfortunate bump, no!  The extent and the nature of the damage caused indicates very clearly that there was not an ounce of finesse, no care whatsoever, just a brutal disregard and bad workmanship.  It would be almost impossible to cause this much destruction should you deliberately try.  The artist contacted the said carriers in early May 2010, and to bring an end to this sad tale.  After nearly three months, they came up with the miserable offer of 298 GBP.  It is less than the cost of sending, phone calls, and one advertisement.  And please don’t forget, the artist must now retrieve all the work he has in this gallery.  The quote for this alone is more than $1000.  A side note to the above, the artist suggested that if the carriers would at least agree to bring back the broken things free of charge, he would accept their offer.  The answer was a flat no!  No names are mentioned here, not from any kind of fear, but from the fact that the artist still has not received the 298GBPs.  Should you Google the said artist/exhibition/gallery, you will get literally hundreds of hits about the show, and an idea of how important it all was to be.  The last word from the carriers is that the artist should have insured the goods with them.  Can you believe it?  You pay them what they ask to ship your goods.

review-35140,,"I have sent a crate from Beijing to Berlin 3 weeks ago. I called DHL in China to make sure that they would deliver the crate to my office, that is the back house second floor (and not only to the front door of the building) since I had a car accident and cannot carry anything. I also called DHL Berlin to ask the same information and both confirmed that I would receive the package directly at my office on the second floor. They called to say that the package would arrive between 9 am and 12 am on Friday and again I made sure that it was going to be brought up since the only person in the office on that day was a small woman. I was told yes, it will be brought up. The DHL man came and said he could not bring the crate up since it is too heavy and that she would have to find a solution herself. He left the crate outside in the back house. I called DHL and they said someone was going to come back and bring it up. At 12, the first woman had to leave so I paid someone else to come and wait. Every 2 hours I would call them to ask when they are coming. I was always told they would come, but it might not be right away. I even said that two men should come since it’s real heavy, but I was then told that if the driver managed to bring it to the front door alone that he will manage to bring it up 2 floors alone. At 18 hours, the other woman had to go so I had to come in the office and wait. I called DHL to say I have dinner plans if the driver can arrive soon, and I was told to wait and someone would come soon. At 20 hours, I called again and a very rude man said no one will come because the working day for the drivers ended at 18 hours and I have to find a solution myself. To make an even longer story short, I had to wait outside (at night) until I finally found 2 guys big enough to pay to bring the crate up. (I waited long since it was raining hard and bringing two strangers to my back office when I am alone is not smart). When I was done with the whole thing, it was 23 hours. Since then I have called DHL 14 times and I always get the same answer, someone will call you back today or tomorrow. It has now been 2 weeks. I also wrote 4 emails and not one single email reply. I guess they are waiting until I forget about it. Plus, it cost money to complain by DHL. I have just calculated my Skype cost calling DHL and I am now at €30. Here is another great way for them to make money. Today is the first time in my life that I put something up in a forum as a complaint. I am so tired of being ignored and I will not stop until I get fully reimbursed. €30 for DHL call, €30 to carry the box up, €60 for the second girl to wait for the DHL man to come back.

review-34630,,"I got a notice from an overseas company in China that my shipment left on Tuesday evening and I received tracking.  Then I tracked and tracked--to my utter shock and happiness, it was in America by Thursday evening! I was so excited!I told my mother to stay at her home on Friday since it was being delivered there. And somehow, no one ever rang the doorbell or knocked loudly enough for someone to hear.  So my husband called DHL and spoke with a representative.  The rep said we could come pick up the package between 6 and 7 p.m. However, their hub is over an hour away and I don't get home from work until 6:40 p.m. So we called again and spoke with a lady who said she could probably get it on a truck out that evening since their driver made the mistake. We would get a phone call from a manager called ""Richard"" within an hour.An hour passed and no Richard called. So once again, we call DHL and we have to track Richard down. Lo and behold, all the drivers have gone home. ""So sorry"" blah blah.  Then, he promised we are the first delivery for Monday. I checked the tracking all weekend and all morning today, Monday. I called my husband and told him to contact DHL since there has been no update since the one from Friday saying ""recipient not home"". So he called their customer service again. This time, he spent 1.75 hours on the phone with some women who, halfway through, updates the website. Literally, right in front my eyes--while I'm at work, I refresh the tracking page and one minute the latest news was: ""18 Delivery attempted; recipient not home Houston, TX - USA 11:00.""  Then, three minutes later it says: ""19 Awaiting collection by recipient as requested Houston, TX - USA 18:50.""  And then nothing else.Today, they told us that someone told them to hold my package instead of deliver it.  So at 2 p.m. we told them to get it on a truck and deliver it now. Apparently that's out of the question.  But why would the lady from Friday suggest putting it on a truck at 7 p.m. on Friday, but it's out of the question at 2 p.m. on Monday? So now they tell me again that we will be the first delivery tomorrow.My main question is, why does it only take two days for a package to get from China to Houston, unharmed and no problem? And why does it take more than two days for a package to be delivered within Houston?From now on, I will always choose either UPS or FedEx and the companies I buy from will offer those options or I'll just take my business elsewhere.  This has been too miserable of an experience. I want no more of it!

review-28578,,"Near the end of June 2010, my sister sent me a package via DHL from Oregon to my home in central Mexico. On July 2, after she had sent it, she realized that she had sent it to an old address where I had lived several years ago. Once she notified me, I immediately telephoned the DHL customer service number in Mexico to ask them to correct the delivery address. I was told that they could not accept any correction until after 7:00 PM on the day that the delivery had failed for the third time and the package had been returned to them.A few minutes later, I entered my tracking number in the DHL website and discovered that the package had been delivered and signed for that same afternoon. Since the waybill was marked for a delivery signature by only my wife or me, and obviously neither of us had signed. I called DHL again to complain. I was told that they could try to recover the package but that it would be better if I went to the delivery address myself and tried to get the package back. I did exactly that and the person at that address told me that she had not been at home at the alleged time of the delivery and had never heard of the man who supposedly signed for my package.I called DHL again, incensed that their driver had delivered my package to a stranger at an address where no one was home. I assumed that the package was well and truly lost, but hoped at least to file a complaint against the DHL driver. I was told that, since the waybill did not specify person-to-person delivery, they were well within their rights to deliver the package to anyone who was willing to say that they knew me and that I lived at that address. They refused to accept a complaint against their driver, since they said they had no way of telling who was telling the truth and who was lying.I lost a renewal credit card which I had to immediately cancel, a letter from the IRS the contents of which I'm still trying to determine, and an irreplaceable handwritten letter from a great-great uncle to another family member, written in 1863.

review-28389,,"I contacted DHL on the 16th of June about sending a laptop to my fiancée in Ukraine. The agent on the phone walked me through all the paperwork that needed to be filled out and informed me that there would be a 20% customs charge when the package arrived in the country before it could be delivered. I agreed to that and sent the package on the 18th of June. Once the package reached Ukraine on the 20th of June, it got stuck in customs under a clearance delay. I did not receive any phone calls from DHL to explain the situation and neither did my fiancée. After two days of waiting, I finally called them to find out what was going on with my package. They told me they had no information and that I needed my fiancée to call their Ukraine office to find out why it is not passing customs.Later that day, my fiancée had informed me that the customs charge was 44% and not 20% as the DHL representative had quoted to me. I informed her to tell them to send it back as that would have cost another $US 400 and that we were not going to pay that. After I found this out, I immediately contacted DHL to request that they send the package back to me and promptly refund my money because their agent misinformed me and lied to me. I would not have sent it with them if I would have known that it was going to cost me that much at customs. I received an email back stating that the package would be returned to me free of charge, but my situation did not qualify for a refund.Now I have to wait till tomorrow to find out if they are actually going to return the package. But they still will not give me a refund even though they are the ones that told me that the customs charge was only 20% even though in reality it is 44%. I believe they are running a scam here telling people false information so that they can steal their money without having to provide the service that they are being paid for. It is now July 1, 2010 and I am waiting to hear whether I will get my package back. And I still feel that they owe me a refund. Don't let DHL steal your money like they have stolen mine.I do not know the total economical damage as of yet. There is the $US 279 that I spent on shipping. The laptop was $US 500, which I am not sure at this point whether I am going to get it back or not. Then there is the mental stress caused by DHL because I lost sleep worrying whether my fiancée would be able to get her birthday gift. Then my fiancée’s mental stress because of the customs in her country. Also, the problem that my fiancée needs a laptop so that we can make plans for our wedding together and can talk to each other about the details.

review-223484,,"Wow. DHL is the worst shipping company out there. I have shipped items before and have never been so ripped off! On December 29, 2009, I dropped off a gift for my fiance to be shipped to Jamaica via DHL at their drop-off location at 3232 Steeles Ave. W. I spoke with a very nice and intelligent attendant and advised her that the parcel was a gift and inquired of further charges if any. She told me to fill out a Pro Forma invoice which would declare the parcel as a gift and would push it through customs with no further charges. I did this, and the package was sent out.On January 4, 2010, I noticed that the parcel said ""Clearance delay"" on their online tracking. No one contacted me or the intended recipient, and the parcel was sitting there from December 31, 2009. I figured being the holidays, things are slow. So I would call. I did and found out that customs was holding the parcel, but the DHL rep I spoke with did not know why. I received a call from my fiance, and he was livid. DHL called him and advised that he would need to pay $21000JAM roughly $260CAD to pick up the parcel. He told me his immediate reaction was ship the parcel back. I told him to cool out and that I would handle it on my side.I called DHL, very confident that this would be cleared up quickly, as I had been assured that with the Pro Forma invoice, there would be no further charges and DHL Canada would handle everything. Boy, was I wrong. The DHL rep told me I filled out the wrong invoice and that I needed to fill out a Commercial invoice ASAP. So I did, and they sent it on to their depot at Kingston Gateway. That was January 5, 2010.Now, it is January 30, 2010, and the parcel is still being held by customs. Jamaica customs supposedly reevaluated the contents of the package which included a cellphone, Bluetooth, mp3 player, and key chain. I paid $225CAD for these items. They adjusted their fee to $14800+JAM. I told DHL Canada that I am not paying a dime and they made a mistake, because they gave me incorrect information and I need the parcel returned to me in perfect condition. For two weeks, I was given the runaround.Finally, I have been told that customs is refusing to return my parcel, because ignorance is not a valid enough reason to return the parcel. If I do not pay the $14800+JAM in 90 days, my parcel will be marked as ""Abandoned"" and disposed of. I told DHL Canada and I sent them a letter that I will not be paying any amount they needed to foot the bill or get my parcel returned somehow. One of their representative, Richard, advised me that it is not DHL's responsibility to know how customs operate in the country I am shipping to and that it is my responsibility, and I should have known what the correct paperwork is needed to ship to that country.So, here is the long and short of it. When you use DHL to ship, you are not paying for the service; you are paying for the name that heads your shipping document. The fact is you are shipping your items yourself. DHL is not responsible for giving out correct information to their customers; when it comes to that, you are on your own. It is not about the money; it is about the principle. I have been reading some of these experiences of others online, and it is apparent that DHL has been doing this for years, and we continue to let it happen. I will not just let this slide by. They are unscrupulous and completely unprofessional!My fiance did not get a gift this Christmas. We are to be married in a few months, and this situation is like a bad cloud hanging over us. The key chain is a something my son bought himself for the man who is to become his new father figure. We wrapped the gift together in Christmas wrapping paper, and my little boy put a note on it himself. My son is devastated that my fiance did not get his gift and can't understand why. In an 8-year-old's mind, fair is fair. We paid for a service and expect the service we paid for. I could understand if I was informed of the possibility of more money needing to be paid and still sent my parcel with them. Then I would be responsible for the COD charges. But I was never informed by anyone, and my fiance has been without his gift for one month now when I was told it would take 2 days to get to him. This is a complete travesty, and living in a ""first world"" country, you would think there is some kind of justice for a disgusting company like this!

This was after she told me they were closed until Monday. She told me it had been scanned 3 more times while in Allentown - 9:19pm and 9:21pm on 10/17, and at 4:17am on Sat. 10/18. When I asked about the number of PA scans she said that I wouldn't understands - not something a disgruntled customer wants to hear. When I rhetorically asked why anyone would use DHL given they didn't guarantee their 2 day deliveries and in fact promised only that would take up to 6 business days. She suggested because it was cheaper... I replied that I didn't consider $30 cheap and could have mailed it USPS for less and gotten it there by now.I asked for a number at the Allentown facility to lodge a complaint and asked he to also send them one on my behalf. The number I called directed me back to the 1-800 number for complaints but offered an option to report missing work. I left a voicemail giving my name, number and reporting my missing work - along with the tracking number.It's too late to fix the mess they've made and leaving that message made me feel only a little better. I strongly urged MBE to drop DHL from their options and pursue getting the refund they offered me out of them. I strongly urge you to look elsewhere for your shipping needs - it isn't worth whatever savings they claim. Time is money too.

DHL,    Good day.   I am a software developer struggling to make both ends meet in the Philippines.  I have 3 kids ages 8, 4 and 1.  In a month i make a measly $500 which i have to budget to meet our needs.   Last month a relative of mine went to the US (California) and i saw an opportunity to get myself a tool which i can use at home so i can do extra work to augment my income for our growing family.  I literally begged my another relative in NY to lend me some money and buy me a laptop in the US.  Laptop prices here in our country are twice that of those in the US.I will pay for this laptop for several months funds will come from a part of my life savings and part from my already small budget, the laptop is equivalent to almost three months worth of salary before taxes.  We opted to avail the free shipping offered by my vendor so that we will not incur further cost.  The laptop was handed over for delivery to FEDEX April 7, 2008 by my vendor in CA We expected the package to arrive in New York April 14, 2008.  But FEDEX delivered it April 17.  The laptop was to be shipped back to CA in order for it to be brought back to the Philippines hand carried.     We selected DHL 2 Day delivery in the hope would be able to deliver the item better than FEDEX did.  To my dismay the DHL courier delivered it to a different address.  Up to now i am still wondering if i will be able to get my hands on the said laptop.  What's worse is that my relative is to go back here in the Philippines April 22-23.   In this light, i am humbly requesting for assistance to be able to locate and deliver my item on time and in one piece.  I have literally cried and lost sleep because of the mental and emotional anguish brought about by this incident.  Worst scenario would be  i will be paying for a laptop that i will not be able to use.  This could mean less food in the table for my family not to mention the additional baggage of paying for it.

Hello, Brooklyn is one of the largest DHL ship center sin the COUNTRY, what do you MEAN no one answers the phone? No executives or supervisors worry about this?  I received a phone call from a supervisor who apologize and swore Id have the cabinet the next day. This, of course, never happened. I called the ship-center again and the woman said that they had a record of it out for delivery and no record sincethat the package was, effectively, missing. This cabinet is 18? by 18?, its not a tiny little box or envelope that could be misplaced. I was so upset I was ready to cry, and then to make it worse, the woman put me on hold for almost twenty minutes before transferring me to Brooklyn. Every time I called back from my cell I was cut off and couldnt get through: it was like being blacklisted. They had to have had my number, because I used my roommates cell phone and got through fine, but after I got another representative and explained the problem and the missing shipment, her phone couldnt get through anymore either. I e-mailed the shipper who got a hold of a manager, but again, all theyd say was that it was in Brooklyn, and then they transferred her to the warehouse that doesnt answer as well.  The representatives were all very polite, but they lied and covered the fact that the company had lost my cabinet.

                            Why I have to pay storage fee? It is not my fault.I want to solve the problem, but at the DHL Peru nobody care and DHL USA dont care easer. They send me from one person to other.My time, I spend money for phone calls (1 month phone calls), for notary, translator (I dont know Spanish), storage and service fee (I did not pay yet). I did not see my package yet, I dont know if it has damage.

review-223436,,"DHL driver delivered a package addressed to me to the wrong place. On their tracking site it said that the package had been delivered. I called them and told them that I did not get it. They siad they would look into it. Then they said that they delivered it to the wrong address because the name was similar to mine at that address. To make a long story short I never got the package and I had to get Dell to send me another one. DHL clearly had no concern about it because someone that I never heard of signed for it and then lost it I guess.This was a mission-critical computer component that delayed for at least two-weeks the deployment of a new server/backup system. This was very costly and very dsiruptive to an ongoing operation. DHL took no responsibility and told me so.

review-223435,,"I consistently cannot receive deliveries at home from DHL. They can't find where I live. I've taken time off from work to sit at home waiting for them, and then I get an email message stating I've given them the wrong address. I have to call their customer service and explain that I live in a condo, that my mailbox number is number one--nothing to do with them, all they need is the four digits of my street address. They ALWAYS say they can't find unit number 1 (it's my mailbox number, not our unit number). Driving me CRAZY! There's one site I order from frequently that gives me no shipping option other than DHL. WHY ON EARTH the driver can't pick up the phone and give me a call, I have no idea.

I've paid for 2-day service, but I won't get my package for 5 days (they don't try again on Saturday.)They've lied to me, failed to follow up, failed to try anything extra (like calling me when they were in the neighborhood) to rectify the situation, and have wasted my time and money.

review-223434,,"First time they delivered a package to the right address, wrong street, but signature required. It is lucky I have an honest neighbor who found it unsigned for on his doorstep. Tracking said: delivered and signed for. Next they would not deliver without an apt # that the sender faxed me. DHL forgot to put # on bill for driver. Now DHL first disavowed knowledge of tracking #, then admitted they delivered it somewhere--but nowhere near me. Yet they have my correct address. My first phone call to them resulted in a big runaround with a promise to call back in less than 2 hrs. No call back. I called and go the same runaround and promise to call back in 30 mins. Ninety minutes later I called back: Closed for the night. That's big business today--they don't care. USE UPS or even USPS. Thanks for listeningNo one has gotten back to me yet, just promises....
