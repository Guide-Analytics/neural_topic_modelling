0,ReviewRow-852,They're either stealing or the worst delivery service in America.,"I've noticed an increase in online sellers using LaserShip and since November of last year I've received ONE of the eight shipments meant to arrive. ONE. They all ""get lost"" at the facility 15 miles from my house. No one ever has any answers and then the seller has to issue a full refund. Smells like either an insurance fraud scam or just straight up theft.

What are LaserShip employees doing with all those ""lost"" items I wonder?

Laser ship decided against my wishes to ‘deliver' to the leasing office instead of the address on the label. I say ‘deliver'. Because I have never received that package. Laser ship's answer when questioned is ‘call the seller we delivered.' Well no you did not and I want to know why?

Their customer service is unresponsive to the email requests, doesn't answer phones and takes another 4 days to get a live person to find out why it hadn't left Charlotte. Then 24 hours later do not send email, just update on the tracking(you have to check there) that it's in exception... that's crazy. And their response is call your seller and see if you can work something out. I also had packages from Bath & Body works disappear into that same ""lost zone fir days on end).

208,ReviewRow-800,They Deserve Every Bad Rating & More. AVOID this company! The worst!,"On my security camera I saw a guy drop off a package on my front porch. 1 min later I retrieved the package. It was from The GAP, not addressed to me, did not have my address on the package, not even close. How this driver picked my house I have no idea -- through Google Maps I saw the actual delivery destination was about 1/2 mi away.

I scanned the bar code to find the shipper's info (LaserShip) and immediately reported this misdelivery to LaserShip, who promised the package would be picked up and delivered to the correct recipient. Eight hours later I called back as no pickup occurred. Agent #2 told me the case had never been entered into their system. So I reported the misdelivery again. The agent said the package would be picked up. Next day, the package was still on my front porch, awaiting pickup.

Feeling bad for the intended recipient, who was probably wondering where her package went, and fed up with the lack of action and no follow-up or accountability by LaserShip, I took the package and drove it to the customer's house. The recipient was very grateful.

I can't stand incompetence and a ""whatever"" attitude, and this company has it in spades. The delivery driver has probably misdelivered many packages, since he randomly threw this package at my front door. Had it not been for me taking the initiative and doing what the delivery driver was clearly unable to do, the customer would never have received the items she ordered.

I am spreading the word. Tell the companies you buy from online NOT to use this ""last mile"" delivery service. They are horrible. The worst.

After waiting an entire day for the scheduled delivery of the package which never arrived, I then made an email inquiry to Lasership the next day asking for a delivery update on my package. They wrote me back two days later saying that they were unable to confirm control of my package and that I should contact the Seller for further assistance. A few minutes after receiving their response, I got a notification on my phone saying that my package was delivered. I was in the yard at the time for over an hour and can verify that no one showed up to deliver the package. You see, I can forgive the driver or warehouse worker that may or may not have stolen my package. What I cannot forgive is that Lasership blatantly lied when claiming that my package got delivered while knowing full well that it was stolen by someone in their employ or maybe even by the company itself. Although Walmart gave me a full refund on my ""lost"" order, as long as they continue to use Lasership in my area, I will never order online from them again.

On tracking info, they say undeliverable due to weather. Ummmm... no snow here and it is at a local hub a half hour away. Thing is, we all know from the reviews this delivery company is a sham, so it actually makes me not want to purchase from the companies like Bath and Body Works who signed contracts so they could get rock bottom pricing from LaserShip. What does that mean to us customers? Higher prices go in effect because they are replacing broken or undelivered items.

It is a photo of a package in front of a door (LOL). We have 2160 apartments here with same door and same floor. I opened an query after missing 2 deliveries within the difference of 3 days. There was a automated generated email came saying that they are trying to solve the issue and taking it very seriously. After that 1 week passed with no update so I decided to call the customer service and with no surprise they are not taking the responsibility and telling me to solve it with the seller. Lasership never delivered those orders to my address and showing delivered. God knows where they delivered them. Also, why my sellers should incur the loss while they did not do anything wrong? Very disappointing 'LASERSHIP'. Need to be far far more efficient to compete with the other shipping companies. Hope you guys understand that.

272,ReviewRow-814,An embarrassment,"Honestly, I'd give 0 stars if possible. I ordered boots through JustFab and this company was responsible for shipping it out. The first pair of boots somehow arrived a couple days late- which wasn't the issue. I had to send them back and receive exchanges because they were too big. However, I never received my exchanges because they arrived over 10 days late and I wasn't at my building to receive them. I called the company and emailed the company Prior to see if I could pick them up because I was leaving for the holidays but they never responded. The delivery man left my package in the corridor instead of taking it to the front desk (which they are instructed to do... special delivery instructions) and my package was stolen. I contacted Justfab and they sent me a different pair of shoes since the ones I wanted was out of stock. As of yesterday (Jan16,2021) were lost. I also contacted Lasership via telephone in hopes to pick this package up because when I tracked it, the order was already in the city I lived in. To avoid problems with delivery I figured I'd grab it myself. The lady I spoke with said someone would call me back to give an address on where I can pick up the package, but nobody called. The tracking app I used say that there was a delivery ATTEMPT that had failed, delay due to whether and other delays for no given reason. Today I woke up to an email saying my package was lost and to contact justfab. I called them and they said the expected delivery date would be tomorrow. I asked her if there was a way I could drive to grab the package myself, but she told me to just call Lasership again. When I called Lasership, I spoke to an extremely rude man named Daniel that seemed as if he had no desire of helping me. I explained to him my situation and he cut me off and said it's unrealistic to have a delivery date if the package was lost. I gave him my shipping number- which I'm not so confident he got all the digits correct- and he just said there was nothing he could do and to call justfab back. I've left out details of how Lasership's employees have just made loops and holes to avoid telling me the issue with my package, but now I have to wait for a THIRD pair of shoes to arrive. Mind you, I was supposed to receive these boots before Christmas of 2020. I'm not confident I'll ever receive the shoes I wanted but I am confident that I'll never order anything from a cite that uses this shipping company ever again. If you're in the East Michigan area, I highly suggest you choose another shipping company as well.

283,ReviewRow-885,If only I could give zero stars,"I love in a large apartment complex. Every building has about 8 apartments. Entry to the buildings is locked. To gain access to the apartments you have to have a key to the building or you must buzz the apartment you are visiting or delivering to. Delivery drivers have the option of obtaining keys from the management office, which is open 7 days a week. We also have a locker system that carriers can put packages in. There are numerous options. Despite this array of options, the drivers for Laser Ship think it is appropriate to leave packages outside of the buildings by the main door. In other words, an insecure area. I have had a few packages stolen.
However, this last incident involves them delivering to, judging by the picture, a house. The notes say it was left at the ""front door"". I live in an apartment, I don't have a front door. The picture looks like the package was left on a porch. Again, I am an apartment dweller, I do not have a porch.
I have complained to this business through their ""customer service"" number and by calling one of the local terminals. For this case I have called and emailed. Nothing has been resolved.
1 star is generous. Avoid retailers that use them. Ulta and Chewy use them in the Indianapolis area.

At 7pm, I told myself that I should check my phone to see if there were any delivery updates. That's when I saw that they ""Attempted Delivery."" It said that was at 6:30pm. I never heard anyone outside my house. I looked outside and there was nothing. I living in a detached house, where it's easy to walk into my porch. I don't have any dogs or anything that would prevent them from delivery. I then called them up. I then spoke to customer service. They put me on hold for 30 minutes. Then the dude had kids screaming in the background. He tried putting me on hold again but patched me into another call. Then he realized what he did and talked to me again. Said he would look into what happened and put me on hold again. Then I was hung up on. I then emailed their website and no one responded. Next day, I made a Tweet about their service. Lasership responded to me there and we got into private chat. They said they would find out what's going on. This is where they decided to retroactively update Amazon and their website to say that they delivered at 8pm, on Saturday, the day before. So now I'm livid. Now the person in chat says they'll look into it, it'll take 2 business days, and to contact my seller if it takes longer than that. This is where I went ahead and called Amazon, who took care of it for me. I hope to never deal with Lasership ever again. It's one thing to tell me there's a delay or it's lost, it's another thing to lie about what happened to my package. I don't like dishonesty. There have been prior times where they've marked my packages as Delivered, only to show up with my package 15 minutes later. You're supposed to scan it at my door.

385,ReviewRow-724,"Mediocre customer service, pathetic delivery system. Do not expect your package to be delivered.","I wouldn't give any stars, but I'm forced by the system to provide at least 1.
I had an order with Nike, and my package was ""routed to the incorrect delivery facility"" 2 times in a row. One time is understandable, but 2? My package information hasn't even been updated since it was ""routed to the incorrect facility"" and I have no way to know where it is or what may have happened to it.
In addition to that, I asked to pick up my package at the Lasership facility (where it supposedly was) in either Durham or Charlotte, to which one customer service agent said ""that is not permitted"" and another said ""I'll give you a call back once we schedule your pickup time"". Their customer service provides different answers and is not considerate of customer concerns. I never received a call to pick up my package, and after 8 different calls (25+ minute wait times for each call) I was told to file a complaint/refund with Nike. This is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason I'm complaining is because I can't buy the shoe at the price I purchased it of $200 because resell is now $500+
If you want to actually receive your packages and not have to go through numerous calls with pathetic ""customer service"", DO NOT use Lasership (also referred to as Lazyship by numerous online reviewers). They are irresponsive to customer calls, and each of their customer service agents provides a different response. It almost seems like I myself have more information about the package than their ""customer service"".

After further research about this company, there is a collective testament on sitejabber and BBB about packages being marked as delivered, but not delivered and more. Their customer service number is a front - and the likely chance of someone picking up is slim to never.

I'm not sure how the CEO Ali (Lasership) is acquainted with Elon (Amazon), but it's funny how complaints and concerns on the BBB date back to 2016, with no resolution. To add insult to injury, a bland HR stimulated response through their Customer Service personnel ""Isabel"" is their way of resolution: ""we heard you and we are sorry.""

This would be considered at least, a breach of contract for failing to provide a basic level in courier services.

Packages have been sitting 5 days apparently on the tarmac of Detroit Metro in Romulus.
This is EVERY SINGLE TIEM.

And most times they put ""inclement weather"" even when it's 70 degrees and balmy.

Once these fools didn't deliver makeup or hair dye from Walmart. The replacement package these scumbags, OPENED, began mixing the hair dye. Had no idea how to proceed so must be a man, shoved all items, OPEN, back in the hair dye box.

They also removed the security seal and used a lip gloss.

You can't make this stuff up.

I do not understand how the government is not investigating and why there are not more Class Actions.

Here's the translation: The LaserShip guy driving packages around in his own car wanted to get home for his favorite TV show, but still had a bunch of packages in his car... so he marked them all as ""Attempted Delivery"".
At the two week point, I got in touch with WalMart, who promptly cancelled my order and refunded me. Since then, I've had three separate LaserShip drivers showing up and trying to deliver this package, and each time I've told them I'm refusing the delivery (as WalMart instructed me to do). Yet they keep showing up.
I just KNOW that I'll come home one of these days to find the damned thing on my porch, and I will have to bring it to WalMart to return it.","October 27th, 2020",1,0,Mike F.,1.0,2021-05-30 11:29:43.474106,2021-05-30 11:29:46.729005,LaserShip,Sitejabber

When ordering from a retailer that uses them, I suggest upgrading from standard shipping to avoid shipping through LaserShip. My package was sent to their facility on 04/05/21. It was out for delivery but somehow ended up back at their facility, why? I had been in communication with someone at the office located at 8475 Western Way #160, Jacksonville, FL 32256. She continued to give me the run-around about my package. My tracking # states that my package is at their facility. However, no one can locate my package. I finally had enough and asked to speak to a manager. Of course, he was not available, so I was transferred to a voicemail. I did leave a message and have yet to receive a callback. I called back today, 4/12//21, and spoke with another female. She was confused as well about where my package was. A guy came on the line that said he was the manager and proceeded to talk over me as I was trying to get answers, then yelled. ""your package will be reported lost, call the seller for a refund or a replacement,"" then hung up! Really?!?! Are you serious!?! I am very disgusted that any retailer would do business with this company. I need answers as to what happened to my package! The ""manager"" advised me to call the retailer and ask for a refund or have them reship it. How unfair is that to me as the customer and the retailer? Are the employees walking away with packages and advising customers to reach out to the company for a replacement or refund? Either way, this is sad!

464,ReviewRow-562,"Absolutely horrible company, do not use them!","I ordered 4 gallons of engine oil from Walmart.com because they had the best price for the particular oil that I needed, and they offered free two-day shipping via Lasership. I had never heard of Lasership before, and had I known that their reputation was so horrible, I would've spent a few more dollars and purchased engine oil from Advance Auto Parts or Autozone.

I placed my order on 9/25/2020, and was told that it would arrive by 9/27, or 9/28 at the latest. After waiting for a week with no delivery or any kind of message or phone call from Walmart or Lasership, I checked my Lasership tracking number, and found out that my package was ""delayed"" at their facility in Kennesaw, GA. After waiting another week with no delivery or any updates via their tracking website, I called their customer service number, and was told that their Kennesaw facility was experiencing delays, and that they would call me when my package was ready to be picked up and/or shipped. Amazingly, a few days later, I received that call, and they asked me if I wanted to drive to their Kennesaw facility and pick up my package in person, or have them ship it from Kennesaw to my house in Marietta, GA. Unfortunately, I made a big mistake by telling them to ship it to my house, and not telling them that I would go to their facility and pick up my package. I was expecting them to call me and let me know that this had happened, but I learned that on October 14, the package was reported as damaged, and that it was shipped back to Walmart. I had no idea that this had happened until I checked my tracking number on their tracking website. I called Walmart customer service, and was told that they could either refund my order, or send out another one. Unfortunately, they told me that they can't use any other carrier besides Lasership, so I will be pursuing a full refund

If you learn anything from this review, it's that if you order something from a large corporation such as Walmart, make sure that you look at the shipping policy very carefully, and make sure that a company like Lasership won't be involved in the shipping & handling of your package, because there's a good chance that it will never arrive, will be damaged in transit, or in my case, both.","October 21st, 2020",1,0,Henry S.,1.0,2021-05-30 11:30:45.062058,2021-05-30 11:30:49.280923,LaserShip,Sitejabber
465,ReviewRow-1003,"Carelessly, Unempathetic, Profit over Customers' Wellbeing...","Today my wife and I saw a large open empty Amazon box left outside our building on the premises. When we checked our account, a Lasership courier left the box outside the building & did not ring our bell. The Tracking ID: LX96878830. Someone stole the contents worth over $50. We file a complaint w/ Ymani from Lasership.

This is the 2nd time in a month that a Lasership courier has left deliveries outside the building (the first time my $300 headset for work went missing), despite the clear signage that asks not to leave packages outside. On May 4th, 2021, when I spoke with Kevin from Lasership's head office, he assured me that he placed a notice for the courier not to leave mail outside, so this will not happen again. We also have not received the result of that initial investigation. Attached is proof.

There is an increasing concern that Lasership & its couriers are disregarding safety/privacy to ensure that customers receive delivery, especially sensitive items that could jeopardize our identity and wellbeing.

I called them back again at *******590, the agent said sorry and promise that would be delivery on Wed 12/16/20 instead. Guess what, nothing been delivery again!. It keep repeat like that over and over till 12/19/20 Sat. They sent my packing back to the sender after I had been called and gave them all information they said they need. Each time I called ( not mention about each time I called, it took about 15 mins to get agent on phone)the agent told me the different things, one of them even said that the supervisor would call me but no one did. Those agents will talk vey nice to you and promise to fix problem for you but trust me, there is no action from them at all. Their operation system is extremely terrible between the agent, facility and driver. I am strongly warning everyone to stay away from this company.

I was home waiting for the package and knew no one even attempted let alone got out of the car. I called Lasership and spoke to someone a lazy sounding guy who said I can't track your package. I asked for a supervisor he connected me to voicemail. I called back got a white woman in Virginia the other representative was black. I spoke to her and told her that any reputable company has the ability to track a package and its within the hours so if I need to I will go meet the driver and literally drive to go pick up my package. She told me she couldn't help either and I said what is the point of having customer service if you can't do anything. They need to just route these calls to the Philippines like they do other companies and do away with the customer service. Her boyfriend then got on the phone and said ""shut the $#*! up nigga"" to which I replied is your boyfriend a tough guy? Is he a gangster? And she hung up on me. Then a supervisor called me back and I told him I don't want the woman fired I want her to understand the value of customer service and importance of everyone doing their part. He seems sincere and wanted me to get the packages and was going to follow up. Here it is next day still waiting and they said ""oh they loaded it up but probably won't be before five"" I asked so when? No reply. Like someone is supposed to sit around and arbitrarily wait and hope that they get the package. I pointed out to the guy they have 584 Better Business Complaints filed and a 1 star rating on google. How these guys are even allowed to operate is incredible. Amazon needs to clearly let a customer know their item will be shipped Lasership as this is the worst service I've ever used in my entire life.

No one cares at this company, LaserShip, and it amazes me that they are able to be in business.

The driver couldn't find the street address of the Post Office; which is shameful but marked the package delivered. Supposedly, it was returned to the distribution office but I was only contacted after the Post Office closed. I called LaserShip to dispute that I had not received the package and there was no way to deliver to the Post Office on Sunday. The customer service representative took my home address and mobile stating that the driver would ring me upon delivering. The next day I got a text alert stating it was delivered. It had not been delivered to my home address.

The next day I went to the Post Office 3 times in search of my package to no avail. The day after that I checked the post office to no avail. Eventually was able to get in contact with LaserShip customer service only for them to send me a picture of the fact that the delivery driver left the package in the self-service customer area of the Post Office. This is beyond incompetent. Every time you call customer service there was a 20 minute wait time, people hanging up on you and supervisors making promises as long as they don't have to truly provide customer service. I wasted 2 days of my life with a company that clearly doesn't value customers or even care at ALL. This company is beyond shameful. I truly wish I could provide pictures to illustrate how inept this company is on the basic level of delivering a package.

Please look at where my package was delivered. Out of view of attendants. The delivery person even thought it was ok to take the 1st photo.

I checked the Ring video of my neighbor across the street. The LaserShip female employee delivered the package on 7/12@ 5:26 when the photo was taken.

NOT ONLY DID THE LaserShip EMPLOYEE LIE ABOUT THE DELIVERY DATE, I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S PART OF THE THEFT SCAM I WITNESSED ON THE VIDEO!
I contacted LaserShip customer service, (another joke) and spoke with Miranda who was working from home in MD. I asked her name, and the location of the company, which she gave me, she volunteered the rest of her information. Miranda said she couldn't find a manager to help me. She stated that she had my info from the caller id, and shipping ticket, and that someone would contact me. I was mid sentence of a statement when she abruptly hung up on me. I couldn't believe it, but the character of the company continued to show itself. Miranda must have thought better of her faux pas, and called me back about a minute later to say she heard me say something before she hung up. I let it go because at that point I knew help was not imminent. I was wasting more time on this sham company than it deserved. Subsequently, I emailed the videos of the delivery and immediate theft to LaserShip. I also emailed Sephora to let them know the company they are using to ship is stealing from their customers. I explained in detail what occurred, and that I had video to prove my claim. I also expressed I felt violated and appalled.
After reading reviews of LaserShip on this and other sites, including the Better Business Bureau, I see LIES and THEFT is a common occurrence with this company. Sephora needs to take notice, and address this egregious problem. I understand that the theft rate for Sephora may seem incidental to them because of the size of the company. But on the other side of this are the consumers who are spending their money with Sephora. We are the ones actually being affected with the frustrations and violations of dealing with this trash company.

I tracked the package and according to Laser Ship, it was left at my front door. I did not receive the package. I live in a somewhat closed off neighborhood, so I highly doubt I was a victim of a porch pirate. That being said, I called Fans Edge customer service and my call was answered by a ""live"" customer service rep in a timely manner. No questions asked, the rep said the cost of my item will be refunded, and it will take up to 7 business days to see the refund on my statement. Christmas is next week, so it may take longer for me to see the refund. Excellent customer service experience with Fans Edge and easy to deal with. Bummed I will not receive my item since it was a Christmas gift and I lose out on the cost of shipping (about $12) but at least I won't be out $68.

Called lasership customer service at 7:30 PM eastern time and finally got a response at 9pm. Our representative did not care at all about our package or our situation and even admitted that the driver left it at an address 2 blocks away from ours but is unable to retrieve it. Their protocol calls for a 2 business day investigation where the driver has 2 business days to retrieve the package and bring it to the customer. If the driver is unable to retrieve it after 2 days, the customer needs to reach the seller to say that the package is lost even though it's the shipping company's fault. Shipping is paid for and the company admitted the package was delivered to a different address and they continue to do nothing about it. We asked if the driver could bring it to the correct address multiple times and our representative stated that since it's a 2 day process, they cannot do that. They basically told us that their driver can literally drop off a package anywhere he/she would like to and it is no fault of the company or the driver. This sounds like a driver can get away with stealing packages rather easily and apparently Lasership is not at fault at all. In fact we need to contact the seller saying its lost even though it is their fault.
The customer service was also absolutely horrendous and they showed no empathy for our situation at all and made it sound like it was our fault.

Then, I got notification from Carters that my package was delivered... at that exact time I was outside and the van was a few houses down. I Called Lasership, waited on hold for 45 mins. The rep told me it was delivered to me and told me the description of the location it was left. Which didn't entirely match-said I had a black mat, which it isn't, but from a distance could look black. This leads me to believe the driver stole the package. He got a description on my house from a few houses down then marked it delivered! Had I not been outside while this all happened, I would have believed that it was stolen from someone driving by... which is what you would normally assume, not assume the driver stole it! I really hope this company goes under! I order online a lot and never had any issues like this from any other courier!

So then what happens? Well, they leave it the next day. This is perishable food on ice and they carelessly left it outside my building in sweltering heat.

802,ReviewRow-316,A lesson learned with Lasership,I purchased an item from Walmart online and was glad to know that the item I purchased was qualified to be free of charge delivery... plus my item was coming the very next day... but the downside to it was... that if you purchase an item online there's no way or how you will know who is your courier in charge to deliver your item. (So that part was a nerve wrecking for me because I prefer always USPS). When I found out about this company Lasership... I was confused and follow my item through the Walmart tracking service. I was hoping that in between their stops it would be transferred probably to another courier most preferably USPS? But no... they were the one in charge straight on. I continued to follow the tracker (which really is only a pink bar filling until it reaches its end) when finally I saw that it was reaching near to the end I simply turned away my eyes off my phone for just a few and saw that my item was delivered. I was paranoid! I right away said WHAT? But to WHO? I kept refreshing the tracker (but through walmart app) and it only said delivered. I called lasership customer service and I was there on hold for too long no one was attending. So I emailed them and got no answer. I was left puzzled without knowing about whatever happened with my item and to who it was left with? I tried again using the tracker but I copied and paste it directly to lasership website tracker bar (not from walmart app)and it was more detailed with who it was left with. Which came to my relief because it was left at a corner store near me. I recommend when tracking your item don't track it through the online store you've purchased track it through the courier website that's delivering your item.

Phone call from Walmart. (recordings should prove otherwise who is
Telling the truth after I file a claim/suit). All in all, lasership was

Luckily, Bath and Body Works sent out a replacement package. I was worried so contacted LaserShip and asked them to have the delivery guy request a signature & ID from me, just to insure that it was going to the right address this time. LaserShip responded to me and stated that my instructions were sent to the delivery facility & not to worry.

On the day of delivery, I made sure to be sitting by my front window (since 7AM) to make sure I would receive my package, I also had my ID on hand. I was sitting down and heard a big thump outside my window - the delivery guy threw (literally threw) my box on the ground and walked away. I shouted for him to wait - but he was on his phone and continued to walk away. By the time I got outside, he was halfway down the block, and there is construction work being done, so my calls to him fell upon deaf ears.

I was so livid! He didn't ring my doorbell or ask for my signature or ID - he threw the box to the ground and left. The box was all beat up, which is fine - but all of my sprays caps were off and 2 are cracked. My candle's lid was off as well.

My package had NO tracking all day. At 8PM suddenly there's a tracking #, never heard of these scammers before. At that time, said ""Delivered"".

They just stole my not-worth-any-money to anyone else Walmart order, yet marked it DELIVERED at 1PM. I was working in my front yard at 1PM. There was no delivery person.

See Sephora reviews, so the delivery driver thieves know there's something valuable in the box. There have been reports of not just missing expensive makeup, but of the products being tried out, used, put back in the box! Disgusting.

This so-called ""company"" shouldn't be in business. They've been stealing from customers for the last decade. This company is LYING THIEVES who you can't be bothered to pay decent wages or benefits, so they 1099 them. This sham should be shut down for good.
Start charging the 1099 workers the value of every missing delivery. I bet that they will all be delivered properly then.

UPDATE: Very next order from Walmart, it was listed as FedEx, but for some reason these idiots get the last part of delivery.

My large box had been opened and re-taped, there were a few boxes from Walmart, but this one had different tape on it. This was unbelievable.

~Splat 30 No Bleach Semi-Permanent Hair Dye Midnight Ruby Red - the box was open, the tip of the dye had been snipped off with scissors, and about 20% of the product was gone, all over the inside of the box!

~L'Oreal Paris Feria V48 Intense Medium Violet Application Permanent Haircolour - top of box, where there is a plastic seal, had been peeled back. All of the contents, which is 5 items, had been pulled out and shoved back into the box, so now they barely fit, they were upside down.

So someone from this co. Not only TRIED out one hair dye, they opened the other box to see if they might want to try that one too, but it was a mixture that had to be made, too much trouble, and re-closed it back into the box. Outrageous!

At a minimum, he's a serial philanderer who pretends to be a virtuous, pious, family man. Please don't be fooled by him putting on the innocent act or morally superior act. He can be stealthy in his attempt to fool people. He, unfortunately for him, was transparent to me very quickly. It's as if he is playing a character in a play, with very thoughtful displays of his personality. He completely puts on the especially innocent, wouldn't hurt a fly, shy or sweet act, which is easy to believe. You shouldn't take your first impression of him or any of them at face value. If you don't know a person well, they can mislead you into thinking they are innocent or sweet. The only real way to know a sociopath's true personality is by getting to know them well. But if you listen to your intuition, you may get the feeling that their persona is just too simple to be real. Non-sociopaths are genuine people and not a perfect picture of a simplified personality. Being a fradulent and posing as a good guy is something he spends countless hours trying to hone. Narcissists & deviants can be difficult to spot, especially if they are older and more sophisticated in their tactics. Over time, they learn how to optimally or try to manipulate their victims, and get by with their schemes without anyone questioning them. Please don't believe his hype, Tom Mara is one sick, disturbed individual. He tries to hide it, but it's there. After all, he's nothing more than a salesman, a salesman akin to one who sells used cars.

What makes it even more confusing is that they don't all act the same way. But there are actually three distinct types of narcissists who act very differently on the outside.

One of the toughest sub-types to spot is the covert narcissist, because they blend into the background much of the time. They aren't a cliché of a grandiose, self-obsessed, ""look at me"" narcissist, Instead, they are quietly cruel and behave in a much more passive-aggressive way.

WARNING: PLEASE BEWARE OF Predatory, serial-philandering, sick men there, including but not limited to, effeminate Tom Mara who feign victim when they're exposed, outed or confronted.

I would just like to warn anyone looking for a position with this Company. Most of the people there are unskilled labor just trying to make ends meet. It's very diverse, which is a good thing, but then you realize, people are stuck there, with little to no education. LaserShip counts on this ignorance or lack of the ability to see that anyone has the ability to go somewhere where they can prosper and thrive.

I would say this isn't a company for anyone with any integrity. It's especially not fit for females. Predators to the Nth degree. All in management, sales especially.

Remember Uber, Fox News, Harvey Weinstein of The Weinstein Company, Google, and countless others, in the news? You NOW have an idea of what LaserShip is like. It's culture was and probably still is like that of Fox News when Roger Ailes was there. A bunch of dim-witted, philandering, misogynist Neanderthals (throwbacks to an era in the 50s) who haven't realized that growing up and not cheating on your wives, (realizing that they're not just props and something to hide behind), while you're running all over town looking for ""strange"", is not that bad. Beware of all of them, who pretend that they're family men and the ones who, especially project that they're so virtuous & religious (Tom Mara, to a tee)-- that projection is the red flag.

865,ReviewRow-63,LIARS AND THIEVES... THIS COMPANY IS GARBAGE!,"So my car dies and i order a jumpstarter from walmart on August 24th. I track the package on walmarts site that says its due to arrive sunday August 26,2018. Im like awesome... I thought only Amazon delivered on... so im excited to get my car on the road, good stuff! Sunday comes and nothing, so im thinking eh theyll deliver Monday. I check the site and apparently the marked my package as ""exception"" and that it wont be delivered until the next business day... well Tuesday comes and nothing, wednesday nothing, thursday comes and i contact the company who doesnt reply to my correspondence... the next day they mark it as delivered. NEVER DELIVERED THE PACKAGE MIND YOU... they mark it as loaded on vehicle, out for delivery and delivered in the course of 3 minutes. If that doesnt scream fraudlent I really dont know what does. So Walmarts reps tell me i'll receive my refund in about 5 days... meanwhile my car is still parked outside dead. So while i run the risk of having my car towed i got screwed over by both companies. AVOID LASERSHIP AT ALL COST THEY ARE GARBAGE! BELOW YOU WILL FIND MY TRACKING INFO:

866,ReviewRow-16,Lasership the worst delivery company Ask who delivers before ordering.,"The worst. Lost our delivery from NFL. Com so no shirts for the game. Called customer support and was on hold for 45 minutes. They said the package was delivered on Tuesday. Checked with security gate and the truck came into our gated community. Called Lasership and they said the driver delivered our package to the wrong house, but went back and made the switch yesterday. Said he handed the package to someone at the door. My husband are the only two here and I was at work. My husband was here all day and no one delivered to him. We have never had a missed delivery in 16 years. Don't know who has our shirts. Fortunately NFL.com is resending. One shirt is out of stock so we are SOL, customer service put me on hold when I asked to speak to a manager, got disconnected and am back on hold, Have been on hold about one hour.","September 8th, 2016",1,1,Mary J.,1.0,2021-05-30 11:53:08.782771,2021-05-30 11:53:13.076820,LaserShip,Sitejabber
867,ReviewRow-30,OUR PACKAGE WAS 3 DAYS LATE,Our company placed the order on May 10th. The delivery date was 5-16-17. We emailed and called to make sure they didn't get our address mixed up. Well long story short it is 5-18-17 and the driver came to our address 1 time and then left without speaking with us. A few hours later he shows back up with the same package. Clearly posted on the box was the address printed out along with the corrected address ( written in black marker) we had emailed. He goes into saying they give him the boxes and he don't look at them. Well clearly WRITTEN ONT HE BOX IS THE ADDRESS CORRECTION. OUR PRODUCT WOULD OF NEVER BBEN LATE IF HE WOULD OF LOOKED AT HE BOX.

868,ReviewRow-7,Worst Service Out There,"This is THE worst delivery service out there. The drivers do not even make an attempt to deliver packages. I've been trying to catch this driver for FOUR days now. I have large notices on both my doors to alert the drivers that we are indeed here and this IS the right address. They make no attempts and leave ""incorrect address not deliverable"" on the tracking. As a wholesaler I will out of my way to avoid, and ever refuse to deal with manufacturing that uses this service. I will also encourage every company I deal with to not use and drop Lazership asap. There too many other services that want your business. This company does not want yours. This review is from W. E. Buy LLC. Feel free to contact me about Lazership so I can persuade you from not using them.

Update
Another day with no packages and the tracking doesn't even indicate they've loaded it on the trunk now. 2 days of trying to get through to them on the phone with no results. 2 days of online contact forms submitted for tracking inquiry. No response. PLEASE DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND AVOID THIS COMPANY LIKE THE PLAGE. I will continue to update ALL the online review portals for this company. I have the resources here to do this and I'm dedicating a person to do this until the packages are delivered.","February 26th, 2016",1,2,WE B.,1.0,2021-05-30 11:53:15.294183,2021-05-30 11:53:17.597187,LaserShip,Sitejabber

870,ReviewRow-4,"Vitacost, Chewy and QVC must stop using LaserShip if they want to keep my business...","Review from 3 years ago is below. My updated comments as of today, June 26,2018 have nothing better to add. I have continued to experience awful, awful service from Lasership despite trying to avoid them at all costs. QVC suddenly started using them, Amazon started using them, and now Chewy has suddenly started sending all of my shipments through them. Needless to say, the service just continues to surpass downright $#*!e. I have a current shipment due from Chewy that should have arrived within one to two days due to the free shipping over $49. This will be the second time I have had a problem out of two Lasership deliveries from Chewy. The shipment is in Chantilly, VA on hold with an exception of some unknown type. Customer service has ignored my request for a reason. Instead of one to two day delivery, if it shows up when Lasership is now projecting it to arrive, it will be four day service. That is not what I paid for. I make large enough orders on purpose to earn Chewy's free one to two day shipping. Also, Lasership seems to think it is acceptable to deliver at 10 PM at night when they do decide to show up. Who owns this ridiculous excuse for a company... Donald Trump?! 'Cause over promise and waaaayy under deliver seems par for the course here.

Unfortunately, I recently experienced yet ANOTHER delayed shipment from LaserShip... my eighth in a row. And no, this was not due to weather. This was simply due to LaserShip's continued incompetence in delivering to my area in Central Virginia. I have tried to contact the shipper, Vitacost, with whom I have had to endure Lasership shipping for the past year of delayed deliveries. I have also contacted Lasership each time as well. No decent resolution can be had... just constant assurances that the problems will be reported to LaserShip and the Vitacost higher-ups, blah, blah, blah. The same exact issues occur on every shipment to me. The problem is that LaserShip is out of Dulles, Va, which is a minimum of two hours north of me. When they say a package is out for delivery, it is only just leaving a station two or more hours away. By comparison, my UPS hub is only 10 miles away, while my FedEx station is 25 miles away. The USPS is also only 10 miles away. Dulles/LaserShip is over 60 miles away! Look at a map! I am in central Virginia and LaserShip is in far northern Virginia. When I call LaserShip customer service to ask where my shipment is, even they seem amazed they are delivering this far south in Virginia (almost to Richmond)! To add insult to injury for me, when the shipments don't get lost, they will show as out for delivery, but not get delivered for two or three days after that tracking message shows up! The delivery driver seems to think that ""out for delivery"" means deliver whenever you feel like it. Awful, awful, awful company!","March 19th, 2015",2,6,PJ U.,1.0,2021-05-30 11:53:21.813186,2021-05-30 11:53:24.021432,LaserShip,Sitejabber

873,ReviewRow-206,People just trying to make a living,"After all of the reviews & internet info I read about LaserShip, I was concerned after my packages indicated held up due to ""external problem"". Then I received both packages on 2 different deliveries. The 1st delivery, the delivery person rang my doorbell to let me know my package was delivered. (just like UPS) The 2nd delivery I went outside to get the package (my choice). I had the chance to chat with the delivery man. He was a kind, hard working individual. If he is a representative of the employees of the company, they will provide outstanding service as soon as they get familiar with the area they are working. I only gave an OK, because it would be nice to have an expected delivery date & time. I don't mind packages being held because they only deliver in my area on certain days, as all as they need to do is tell me online. I don't know if that was the hold up in delivery, or not. Give the company a chance. It is a shame that a few bad apples make it difficult for the good ones. As for packages being thrown from cars or stolen - not gonna happen unless someone wants to risk losing their job. They take a picture of the delivery or get your signature.","November 18th, 2019",1,1,Pamela H.,3.0,2021-05-30 11:53:30.572182,2021-05-30 11:53:33.787070,LaserShip,Sitejabber

Reading reviews I have no mailbox for them to shove a package in and they don't get out of their vehicle for delivery. Update tomorrow when they'll try again I suppose. UPDATE*** AFTER REACHING OUT TO AMAZON LAST NIGHT. AND THEY PLAYED IT LIKE IT'S NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THEIR PACKAGE IS DELIVERED ON THE GUARANTEED DAY THAT THEY CHOSE.

875,ReviewRow-162,Laser ship read this,"I called laser and customer service and the rep was very nasty
He said I was on phone for 5 minutes and I didn't give him a chance to talk
I was trying to explain to him the problem I was having
I told him is there a time limit I had to talk so I stoped talking and said he could talk and he proceeded to lecture me that I didn't give him a chance to talk so I asked him if he wanted to continue to llecture me or resolve the issue
I asked for his name he said he gave it to me at beginning of conversation so I said tell me again and his name is dion worst customer service rep ever and if laser was smart they should fire him immediately for his rudeness and obnoxious behavior
I called back a second time and dion answered and said to me oh it's you again and transfered me to another rep. I asked her what her name was and she hung up on me
I called back again and asked another girl her name. She mumbled her name I said I didn't understand what she said she mumbled again and hung up on me
I asked to speak to a supervisor
What do you know. Yep no supervisor available and no one called me back
I called chewy and Amazon and Amazon customer service told me I wasn't the only customer having problems with laser customer service that they're rude to amazon customer service reps too and he said what are we in 5th grade and Amazon cus service told me to go to google to look at reviews that laser is getting and laser has a 1 star rating
Which I'm not surprised
So hear I am writing my review
I guess laser reps don't understand that we pay their salary

876,ReviewRow-8,Yeah... they're a sub par company,"I count myself lucky. I live about an hour from a Vitacost warehouse so when they ship with this ridiculous company I usually get my order the next day. That said, they drive these beat up piece of crap cars that, when you hear the booming base and VROOM VROOM of them trying to sound cool in their crappy cars it scared me because I had no clue who was in my driveway and what they could possibly want. Then some kid gets out with my rather large box and rings my doorbell and beats on my door sending my dogs into a frenzy. Hearing the dogs he literally runs to his car, revs the engine and hauls butt. No ID on the vehicles, ever. UNTIL. Recently they've started wearing uniforms and one time I got a delivery from a brand new VAN with laser ship on it! Once. I guess they can only afford one.

Their tracking is ridiculous. It's never up to date. Their customer service is run with gum cracking young girls (OK, some guys too) that could care less about your package or their job. They really are a terrible company and the one time Amazon delivered with them I complained to them that I expected better from Amazon. Never had another Amazon delivery from laser ship since. Now they just use the USPS which is another bad review...

Demand the company you buy from to stop using this POS company. Maybe they'll go out of business.","February 29th, 2016",3,8,Sandy S.,3.0,2021-05-30 11:53:43.362702,2021-05-30 11:53:47.820144,LaserShip,Sitejabber
