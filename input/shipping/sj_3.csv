0,ReviewRow-152,Unauthorized $78 charge online address change,"On June 28th I did my address change online because the moving enabled me to look for a local post office. Believing that I was paying for $1.95, an insane, unpleasant and unexpected charge of $78 was made for an. Org business which offered adding phone on no telemarketing calls, and another unnecessary service. I called demanding my refund, however it will take 7 business day for me to have my money back. I am shocked how can a business like USPS allow this kind of misleading action.","August 5th, 2020",1,2,Fatima K.,1.0,2021-05-30 10:50:04.337251,2021-05-30 10:50:08.808056,USPS,Sitejabber
1,ReviewRow-222,Dear Santa- my grandson asks where his Christmas present is,"On 12/14/2020 I mailed my 3 year old grandson's Christmas present to him, paying $19.85 for Priority Mail 2-Day. It is now 01/05/2021 and all I have to show is a USPS tracking history abruptly stuck in time on 12/19/2020. Please Santa-promise me next year you will drop off his gift from me while en-route to your destinations. Perhaps the USPS should invest in some reindeer such as yours for future trips.

113,ReviewRow-218,Priority Mail = Glacial Mail,"My nephew sent me a Christmas card on December 18, and he generously decided to send it by Priority Mail so that it would arrive by Christmas. He ended up shelling out $7.75, and the ""expected"" delivery date on the enclosing envelope said ""December 21."" Well, his card didn't arrive until December 29—ELEVEN days after it was mailed! I actually sent him a card too, but with only a regular stamp, and it arrived one day sooner!

Priority Mail should be renamed Glacial Mail, because it's nothing but a scam now. They just grab your money, and give you nothing for it.

So many other problems with the postal service too. I mean, where do I begin?

1) I sent someone a Christmas card on December 9 who lives less than 100 miles away from me. Well, she didn't get the card until NINE days later!

2) A friend in New Zealand mailed me a Christmas card on November 29. Normally his cards arrive in about 10 days. Well, this one took THIRTY days!

3) I ordered a book that was (supposedly) sent out to me on December 10. I have no idea where it is, and the tracking information hasn't been updated in THIRTEEN days. Who knows when—or IF—it'll ever arrive?

I could go on and on. Anyway, FedEx and UPS have their share of problems too, but I'd go with them any day over the totally incompetent U.S. Postal Service, who just take your money—and then offer nothing but excuses.

Please avoid the U.S. Postal Service like the plague, because that's exactly what it is!

115,ReviewRow-174,After 225 years one would think they could do their job,"The US postal service started back in 1775 and over the years it have become a separate entity under the US government, that is the background. At our home we have had many problems with the postal service, wrong packages and mail, missing mail. Since President Trump made the statement to defund them, I was amazed, they got even worse. For this reason I am under the belief this poor response from the postal service is intentional. Part of the reason we have a difficult time with mail delivery is because of the equality in position rather than the top candidate. I really don't care if the entire population of the US Postal service is Asian, or Hispanic or Black or White or any other color you like, BUT they should ALL be chosen due to their testing score, to ensure we are being given the best. Right now that is not the case, in fact we have the just the opposite in some cases. The other problem is they have been given too much and expect more. They have the best healthcare, very good wage and the work is not hard but still they complain. It is time to defund the government operated postal service and give it to the free market so that we can start to get our mail on time, undamaged and from some company that will take responsibility for actions or lack of actions from employees.
Defund and Replace--sooner than later

They whine and moan that they are ""losing money and need to increase postal rates — again but, their service dependability and reliability gets worse and worse with each passing year. A simple card mailed across town ( that also required ""extra postage"") took FOUR DAYS to be delivered. A ""Two-day Priority Mail"" package sent from Pa. To Va. Took TWO FULL WEEKS to arrive and, it was delivered along with my regular daily mail, on my front steps in the rain with no effort to protect it from getting soaking wet. When I sent an email to complain, I was asked to provide ""proof"" of my claim to which I responded with photos and a surveillance camera video showing the mail person dump the mail on my steps and leave. I never heard another word from them. I later received a survey to me to rate the ""service"" that I received in response to my complaint and I responded to advise that I received NO SERVICE OR RESOLUTION. Once again, not another word from them. Not even so much as a fake apology.

Mail is ALWAYS late, misdirected, lost, opened or damaged and there is NO accountability from anyone. Even paying extra for ""expedited"" services is nothing more than a ""money-grab"" for the same, pathetic service. So, to Hell with the USPS! They can't go away soon enough.

I, for one, have completely boycotted the USPS and ANY merchant who uses the ""service"" to ship online purchases. If electronic correspondence is an option, that is what I will use. If that is not an option then UPS or FedEx will be used — even if it is only to send a letter or card. The extra cost for these rare instances will be well worth it knowing that the letter or card will arrive at its destination when it is supposed to.

I sent an iPad along with keyboard, protector and case through priority mail to my 10 year old niece for her to do her virtual schooling online, and the package was either lost or stolen because it never made it to the destination. Weeks later they told me that the package wasn't retrievable so I should put in a claim. I put in my first claim and they denied my claim telling me that I had to bring the package that they lost in to be inspected for damages. How in the world do I bring in a package that you have lost to be inspected? They then told me to put in a second claim which they also denied again for the same reason because they need to see the actual package so that they can inspect it for damages. They told me to file an hearing just to be told the same thing. Why give me the run around if they know that they really don't give a $#*! about my package being lost of stolen. It was weeks of headaches and disappointments. Not only are they disorganize and lack efficiency but they are also lame. I have lost $578 and they could not care less. I don't know how a company that is supposed to be reputable lack such efficiency. And I have had other issues with my packages being lost as well as other family members and friends. They do not take responsibility for your package. When it comes to mailing your packages especially if it is something of very high value, don't walk run away from USPS if you can. Find a FedEx or UPS store to mail your package from. Unless you don't have a choice but have to mail from USPS I would say to brace yourself cross your fingers and pray that your package makes it to it's destination. And if it is lost or stolen don't expect them to care of take accountability for your package. That will be your lost. You may as well just kiss your package goodbye. If I could afford to pay for a lawyer I would sue them for my packages that they lost. They are wicked and do not need to be in operations. They need to get their $#*! together because even a third party mailing company is more reputable, legitimate and is more efficient. They are such a disgrace. They do not need to bail them out with tax payers money anymore. The reason why they have continued to fail is because they cannot deliver efficiency.

A USPS mail carrier attacked my dog with pepper spray. They are NOT allowed to use that on animals unless they are about to be attacked.

My dog was 20-25 feet away from them.
I was only 2-3 feet from my dog and just verbally said to the mail lady, ""Don't worry she's nice! I got her!"" -While clearly going to grab her and take her out of my front yard.
C. My dog was not running nor charging her, nor showing signs of aggression (such as teeth showing, growling, hunched back, tail between the legs). In fact— she was wagging her tail so hard her whole back end was wagging.

This... woman came onto my property to deliver my mail, got to the front porch (with no mask on mind you), and my dog got out of the gate that got left cracked open. Peaches was not running torwards her, she was walking and I was right there next to her by the time she was still 20-25 feet away from the mail carrier. I Verbally explained I was getting her as I quickly rush torwards my dog but before I could even say Peaches name she was masing her. It happened that fast. And she didn't just mase her real quick, she mased her across my yard as my dog is blindly trying to rub her eyes in the grass and get out of the line of fire. She did not stop until I yelled.

That is disgusting and inhumane. I understand people can be deathly afraid of dogs but I was right next to my dog about to grab her and she still assaulted her. If I had moved one second faster she would have hit me in the eyes as well. I am outraged & this is not ok. I called USPS and they agreed it was wrong. I told them she is not to come near here again & she either needs to be terminated OR at the very LEAST, made to go into a mandatory training class' that teaches about how to identify the behavior of an animal and how to access the situation to determine whether you are actually in danger.

What she did was not ok. It was heart breaking and cruel. I would have understood had I not been there to get my dog away from her, but that was not the case this time. My dog is literally the sweetest dog I have ever met. My children use her as a dang jungle gym and she never gets upset about it. She just kisses them off of her. But situations like this, where a person randomly attacks them, can scar a dog and make them fearful. Just as it would a human.

What if I wouldn't have been there when it happened? Peaches would have gotten mased until the can was empty and could have blindly ran into the street into traffic getting herself killed. Her eyes were swollen shut for over an hour, even after bathing, rinsing and soaking them.

Please, feel free to share this, because there needs to be some kind of action taken before that mail carrier or someone else ends up hurting another innocent animal worse then mine. Thankfully I was there but that that may not be the case next time it happens.

I reported it 4 days ago and received a call yesterday from USPS letting my know that they started the investigation and would call me today. I don't know if there is anything they could do to make what happened better, but a good start would be to get that woman off of our families streets and away from our animals.

And while I am here I might as well mention it's impossible to get USPS to take your outgoing mail without chasing them down. Not even leaving a sign up asking works in my neighborhood.

137,ReviewRow-214,Should it have come as any surprise for service to be this BAD?,"Everyone's been hearing about all the problems with mail delivery this holiday season, so I'll add my own to the mix. Before I do, let me state that I do appreciate our local post office staff and delivery people, who I believe are kind, helpful and do their best to serve almost all of the time. My ire is reserved for the many middle managers and administrators within the USPS who tolerate incompetence, lackluster service and who failed to demonstrate the necessary wisdom and foresight to see what was coming during this pandemic holiday season!

Perhaps like many customers, I've experienced more than just one disappointment from the post office since the pandemic began.

First incident: A severely damaged box containing foods was delivered damp with the smell of chemicals on it. It was not only delivered to the recipient in damaged, dangerous condition, USPS did not complete follow-up and our claim on the damaged box has yet to be addressed or PAID (and that was in March!)

Second incident: On 11/12/20 a REGISTERED LETTER--costing over $13-- was mailed to the District of Columbia with estimated delivery date of 11/16/20, appears to HAVE GONE MISSING! How does that happen with REGISTERED MAIL? Isn't that the whole purpose of registered mail-- to keep if from going missing? There has been no tracking information. NOTHING. I tried calling the telephone customer service line to get more information on the process for registered mail and whether I should expect a return receipt to show up. I waited on hold for several minutes then chose the 'call back option' that said they'd call in an hour. More than an hour and still waiting on that return call!

P.S. Tried to provide proofs of purchase but this SITEJABBER website doesn't appear to accept PDF images.

THIRD INCIDENT: Small package mailed to Southern Texas (United States-- NOT MEXICO!) on 11/28/20 with estimated delivery date 12/02/20. Tracking indicates that it didn't make it to the local post office in Texas until 11/28/20! That's exactly ONE MONTH LATER! The Pony Express probably could have done a better job!

FOURTH INCIDENT: Another small package mailed to Alaska on 11/28/20. It too, did not arrive at the local post office until 11/28/20! ONE MONTH LATER! Sheesh! Maybe I should have hired a carrier pigeon!

The sad part about all of this is what has been done to the American people by our politicians and bureaucrats. WE are the ones who have been treated like pigeons and sitting ducks to have to put up with such incompetence in our mail delivery service!

By-the-way, I filled a claim and 10 days later I have yet to hear a word from the USPS.

142,ReviewRow-221,What Has Happened to The United States Postal Service!,"In 2013 when I founded my family/first responder owned & operated shop, part of my vision was to make available professional grade/quality equipment to first responders around the globe. Ofcoarse the ""Bread & Butter"" per say that that keeps the lights on for us is our industry elite upfit shop that converts the highest quality service vehicles on the streets in the US! So over lets say a three year period we struggled working with UPS & FedEx because we just could not seem to deliver equipment to our online customers on-time(within a humanly possible/reasonable timeframe) or in a safe manner! I would bet that 80% of our shipped equipment was either severly delayed and or showed up completely destroyed as if it had kicked accross the country to our customers. And ofcoarse either of these shipping empires ever takes responsibility for the absolutely horrendous service they provide because they don't have to! So in 2016 our Founder/CEO(Matt Sr) decided that we would exclusively moving forward employ the USPS to handle 99%(some situations did force the use of one of the two horrendous carrirers previously mentioned) of our customer bound shippments. To be honest this proved to be one of the best moves he made for us. Because we all of a sudden found that that just about 99.9% of the customers we supplied equipment to had nothing but great things to say about their experience. Not to mention the thousands of dollars lost in previous years due to the terrible shipping disasters had now turned into savings! The USPS had become in our eyes the only option as it seemed they truely cared about not only safely delivering equipment to our customers but almost always on-time and in some cases early!
Well that all changed late this year(2020). Some may speculate it is due to attempted sabotage by our government. Some say it is due to Covid19. I do not know what the cause is but I can tell you that the service provided by our USPS has fallen off so severe that it in our opinion has now become worse than the horrible service previosly mentioned we experienced from the two other options in our country. Priority 3-Day service has now turned into a three week service if you are lucky! I know the holidays, specially with so much online sales activity puts a strain on shipping carriers. But the level of or lack there of service we are experiencing is beyond unacceptable! This is not how you rescue a company from ruin if your experiencing fi. Nancial issues.

The 15th came and it said it'll be delivered then and of course it was not, still half way across the country. Today came which is the 16th and it finally made it to Detroit which I live close to so hopefully covid doesn't stop my package from getting here 4 days late. (Pure sarcasm on covid). The other experience I had was I pre ordered RDR2 and ordered God of war at the same time, paid quite a bit extra for next day shipping on GOW so I could play it while I waited for RDR2 to come out. Both were purchased the exact same day five days before the offical release of RDR2.

147,ReviewRow-164,USPS Saturation Mailing Program,"""ATTENTION TO ALL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS""
I would like to share my companies experience with all small business owners considering using the USPS Saturation Mailing Program and Noni-Print. Noni-Print advertises to help business to reach new customers or to potentially grow your business through USPS mailing solicitation.
BE AWARE AND PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION! We purchased this mailing service, USPS Saturation mailing through Noni-Print for $1,250.00 in June 2020, only to find out six weeks later, that none of the 5000 business solicitation mailers we purchased from Noni-Print never reached their mailing destinations. Noni-Print is in Chicago, IL. At 1532 N Western Ave. We were referred to Noni-Print by a sales representative from the USPS. We will never do business with Noni-Print again or use the USPS other than to mail letters.
After investigating why, we didn't receive a single response from the 5000 mailers it was determined that Noni-Print applied the wrong zip codes to the addresses on the mailing list. They only printed 4800 postcards but charged for 5000 postcards. After contacting Noni-Print owner Mike he would not take any responsibility for his companies' negligence for applying the wrong zip codes or for overcharging us for printing that he did not complete. These types of fraudulent and shoddy business practices will not be tolerated in business or should it be acceptable as a business practice that will be tolerated in my community.
I have reported Noni-Print to the BBB, and they have included Noni-Print to their website, as a business with a poor rating. I have also reported the USPS to the Postal Inspector for referring to us a business with such an unsavory character, and solicitating directly to us a program like the Saturation Mailing Program without having the infrastructure in place to facilitate the service.","August 31st, 2020",1,2,WILLIAM G.,1.0,2021-05-30 10:58:32.584851,2021-05-30 10:58:35.816783,USPS,Sitejabber

The services that you pay for such as (extra insurance, priority services, etc.) are worthless and seem to be nothing more than scams.

As for the customer service representatives, you stand a better chance of getting some assistance from a tribal chief in a Third World country. And to make matters worse, MOST USPS MANAGERS THAT YOU REQUEST TO SPEAK TO ARE INCOMPETENT AND ARROGANT! You're basically beating on a dead horse.

I also sent another package out on the same day (December 9th) to Chicago, IL and on December 15th, some boneheaded postal carrier delivered the package to my daughter's old address even though she submitted a change of address several months prior, now someone else has the package that were Christmas gifts for my daughter and granddaughter. Using the USPS today is like pulling the arm of a slot machine in a casino, because after you put your money in it, there's a chance you might win, and there's a bigger chance you're gonna lose! I'm using a different vendor ( UPS, FedX, DHL) from hence forth because the USPS is a total ripoff! The USPS uses the same tired and lame excuses for lost packages, and the same pressure sales tactics for stamps and extra insurance. What's the sense of buying stamps and insurance if your mail never reaches its destination? I'll NEVER USE THE USPS AGAIN!

180,ReviewRow-61,Postal Insurance? Think Twice!,"As far as I'm concerned buying insurance from the post office is as good as throwing that money down a rat hole. Proof - with a capitol P - is the key, the problem, and the hidden lie. They pay nothing, Zero, unless you can prove not only what you send is actually in the box, but it's Actual Worth; NOT what you insured it for. They just love ppl who buy the larger amount thinking that's what they will get in case of loss. Of course all this is hidden in the fine print that's not even on the little cards you fill out there. Unless you really dig, or read this review first, you find out After you file a claim you've bought nothing but a sham.
The runaround starts immediately with the typical City Hall Stall, then goes to You having to prove that you Did fulfill all the requirements. Then you have to prove what was in the box. Better be well prepared for That. If it's something personal - no matter it's worth - you're sol. Pix and a lawyer might get you somewhere, if it's worth that, but store receipts are all they recognize outside of court. Replacement value, Proven, is it, and any other worth/loss will not even be considered no matter how at fault they are.
There is a secondary problem, the delivery person. Once it's ""delivered"" all else is off, no matter whether you, or who you sent to, gets the package or not. Carelessness doesn't enter into it. Seems that's allowed as mater of course. Thinking your postman would simply put a package behind the stairs, directly under the mail box, where it's out of sight from the sidewalk only six feet away, didn't work for me.
Instead a box with $740 worth of jewelry materials was dropped in front of another address, in the opposite direction, and it was stolen. When I went to file the claim they simply said it was delivered, SOL.
I got the whole story days later when another neighbor, two buildings down, came to me with the box. It was in his trash with the few pieces left that made him suspicious. Talking this around when the police were there other residents said they'd seen the box, and thought how stupid it was being out in plain sight in New Orleans! Back to the post office with this, police report and all, they just shrugged. So what.
It was then I find out that I couldn't have collected Anyway, because if there is any Other insurance, like from a sender, they won't pay on That account. No matter who's fault they don't pay, period.
My advice is to use another carrier, the extra expense. If there even is any. Paid for by the insurance you did Not buy from the post office.","March 9th, 2018",5,1409,Robert L.,2.0,2021-05-30 11:00:40.644626,2021-05-30 11:00:43.880722,USPS,Sitejabber

194,ReviewRow-81,My angry dysfunctional mailmen,"God help you if you ever have a problem with the United States Postal Service. I've been having an ongoing problem with them for 6 months now. The problem stems from my regular mail carrier leaving. Instead of putting a carrier on my route permanently they've decided it's best to dump this large route on other carriers, in addition to the daily schedule these mail carriers already have. So, I have numerous mailmen fulfilling my area weekly and they are the angriest, most disgruntled group of men that clearly DESPISE their job. I've made 25+ pickup requests online. I received a confirmation letter on all of them, so they weren't voided or incomplete, the post office system recognized and accepted all of them. All but one of the mailmen that alternate through here won't acknowledge my requests, never. Even if I leave a one of my whooping 7oz packages in the mailbox for them to simply grab. The one nice carrier that only comes once or twice every 2 weeks is incredible. He has helped me understand I'm not losing my mind, they are in fact A-holes. Then he explained the issue with them getting all this extra work. I guess I'd be upset too, but I wouldn't take it out on the postal customer. I never request pickups for anything large. The largest will be less than a pound. That's obviously not too much for them to handle. When I ran after one of them a few months back, thinking he ""just forgot"" my package he literally tried to run from me, but didn't turn the wheel hard enough and came 6 inches from bashing me with the truck mirror. I was in shock & shaking and barely ask him if he could please take my tiny box, he said, ""We don't do pickup requests in apartments!"" I replied, ""I've lived in 3 apartment buildings the past 6 years and they've always picked them up. I've never heard that ever. Can you at least take this one?"" This was his response. ""Well obviously they cared about their job and NO!"" He sped off. I'm totally serious about this. He sped off leaving me in the dust with my package! LOL! That's INSANE! I had asked his name after he almost smashed into me and he said, ""Jarred!"" I doubt that was his real name. Well, I've contacted usps 4 times now 1 by phone & 3 by email. If you call, expect to be on the phone for about 2 hours. Seriously. I keep contacting them to request a permenant carrier. I can bribe a single carrier with gift cards & refreshments, I can't afford to do it to the 10 non working ones I have now. They only responded to one out of the 4 cases I started and they talked about discipline not hiring someone. Don't discipline, just hire! I used to walk to my local post office 1.4 miles from my home, but I've had back surgery and can barely walk to the bathroom let alone a mile and a half. That's where the closes mailbox is too and I don't drive. I had to stop selling on my favorite buy/sell apps because these carriers are too angry to do their jobs. I thought when I pay the postage fee the post office services were included in that payment, even pickup requests. If ANYONE with common sense from usps ends up seeing this. HELP ME! I had no clue government workers could act like this with no reporcussions. I'm blown away. People, APPRECIATE your mailman/woman if they are good to you! Tip them, gift them, to show your appreciation. I'm going to spoil the F out of the regular carrier I'm crossing my fingers for. From my experience I think they work much harder than what we give them credit for. I'm sure they deal with a bunch of nonsense from people on their route, co-workers & their clueless supervisors. And I say, ""CLUELESS!"" because I live in a HUGE apartment complex with numerous buildings and, somewhere there is a idiot supervisor who thinks adding that huge task to someone's already full route is acceptable.

When I submitted photos showing that the package could not have been left in the mail box, USPS went silent, and screwed me. What a dishonest organization! And, while the Postal Inspectors refuse to protect postal customers when criminals steal your mail, Postal Inspectors open your packages and steal your mail themselves, all with impunity.

206,ReviewRow-49,"Lie about package delivery attempts, poor customer service","We all dread going to the post office, but lately it has gotten much worse it seems. IN the post office the people are rude and act like any question is a huge inconvenience. They don't answer the phone and they lie about package delivery.

Multiple times I've been home, sitting in my living room in my apartment where the front door is clearly audible if someone lightly knocks. Because the mailboxes are one stair flight up, they'll just leave packages by the boxes most times instead of bringing them to the door like they're supposed to. Recently, I went to my mail box only to find the pink slip saying they came to my door to deliver a package from Europe but I wasn't there to sign. I WAS home all day and they NEVER came to my door - the slip was left IN my mail box, not AT my door. This has happened many times now. This time I left a note on the OUTSIDE of my mailbox on the slip saying I would be home for the 2nd attempt and to please bring it to me to sign. Both my neighbor and I waited all day for them to come. I went to check and the slip was gone, the mail was delivered and there was no package! So they had just taken the slip and didn't even attempt to deliver it on the 2nd promised attempt! Now I need to go to the post office to pick it up but have NO slip and NO idea if it's even there!

This is poor service and clearly lying about a job that isn't being done. I'm upset this keeps happening and I wonder why USPS can't provide customer service. Not even the bare minimum that's stated on the slips like attempting to deliver.

209,ReviewRow-51,Private companies for domestic mail services would undoubtedly do much better,"I have been unhappy with this site for several years. I have been able to avoid it for a couple of years, but had to refer to it once again. It had changed. There is some kind of - I don't know - instinct, insatiability, insanity? - for webpage designers and owners to constantly ""improve"" their web pages, but in their attempts they actually worsen their site. Unless a site is truly a horror, improvements should be moderate and gradual. This allows the customer/reader base to grow accustomed to incremental changes (like brainwashing people into cultural Marxism) whereas one great leap forward will simply decimate the base.

I am extremely disappointed with this site. Next time I need information on mailing something, I'll ask someone else to do it. That way, they will build character, and I will be saved much grief and wasted time.

I went to the usps webpage, expecting to be frustrated, but not expecting to have to go to over a dozen pages to find what I was looking for. The United States Post Office Monopoly actively sells up, or tries to. First there is the super premium service at something over $50. Then there is the simply deluxe version for $30 or $40. Almost lastly, there is the really good service for a few dollars. I thought the page was about premium services, so left it, only to be redirected back to it in a later incarnation. So this time I scrolled and scrolled all the way down. Its as if common customers are told to sit in the back of the post office bus, while priority attention is given to the folk with bigger bankrolls. Thats fine. They want revenue. Thats one way to do it. Meanwhile, the hoi poloi are screaming for some enterprising company (since the suits and dresses in the U.S. Congress are unwilling to do so) to develop even more kinds of domestic mail delivery systems, so we can get service that is neither snail-like, scatter-brained, messy, unclear, nor unjustifiably expensive. (I realize the unions have to get their cuts, but even so, prices could be lower. Simply remove a few of the superfluous middle-supervisor, middle-management, middle-department-head, and specialist positions.)

So, finally, by clicking on Buy Stamps I was able to get to a page with different types of services, which gave no clue that it covered normal people mail as well as specialized services and very, very large items. There are many webpages, some pdfs,
A price calculator where you are asked if you are mailing live animals or day-old poultry (along with my Grandmothers birthday card? No, I think not.). You then get to select a service, beginning with the $23.75 express service. I imagine that should be at the bottom of the page, since the fewest number of customers opt for that option. On down, $24.45, nope, $6.65, not for me, $7.20, still way too much, $6.65, last one. Oops Im on another unhelpful page!

Back up two pages, click on buy stamps, gets me to a page that doesnt serve my need. Backup again, click on calculate a price. Back to that unhelpful page. I guess I have forgotten how I got to the page that told me how much it costs to send a letter to a particular foreign address. What a junk-filled, misdirecting, information-concealing work! The juvenile or more likely, self-impressed career bureaucrat who designed this fish (carp) should be released from the self-defensive usps population. But how can you tell them apart?

A word on ""quality"" since I have rated that. Oh, if you could but remember the U.S. postage stamps of the 20th century and before. Some were beautiful works of art, some were pretty, and some merely interesting. Then something happened. Dull, trite, murky, uninteresting images now appear on U.S. stamps. Would that U.S. postage stamp artists were as skilled as the Russian (Soviet) artists of the cold-war era - those were spectacular works of art.

The online account management is usually very good and I love their delivery vehicles lol and usually their delivery people are energetic friendly black men. Haha. U. P.S. tracking is excellent and they will email me the day before a package is scheduled for delivery. I also love the door delivery service. So I admit that I have a preference towards professional couriers, especially U. P.S. I admit that I don't like U.S. P.S. Simply because I like U. P.S.

However, U.S. P.S. Service is completely unreliable. To begin with, they rarely offer door delivery service. I had lived in places where my mail box was not only across the street, but across a busy street. If it fits in the mail box, they will shove it in the mail box. I have had to get Tongs to try to get several small packages out of the mailbox. I have gotten other peoples mail & packages and other peoples have gotten my mail & packages. I have had one delivery person just wedge the package that would not fit in the mail box ON TOP OF THE MAIL BOX! This same person was rough with my mail box and I will admit that it was not screwed in properly. (I did not know because I did not install this mailbox) She was very rude but she did tell me that I needed to screw it in better. But she had no right to pick up my mail box and throw it on the ground. I have gotten many pink slips until I wrote down ""THIS MUST STOP."" on one of the pink slips. I have not had that problem since then. During ""Flood"" season the post office will not deliver. BUT UPS FEDEX ETC. DO! AND RIGHT TO MY FRONT DOOR. I have had mail theft where package was opened and fortunately the contents were still there, but there was still a few items I never got to see. Fortunately I got a refund online but there is a problem. The mega merchants such as Ebay and Amazon DO NOT CARE if there is a problem. Ebay is a B Word (not sure about Site Jabber's policy on such words) to get a refund because ""the seller did their part and they are not required to provide a tracking number."" They almost always use U.S. P.S. Unless you ""hit the jackpot"" by finding the rare high quality trusted ebay seller that will ship / deliver without U.S. P.S. Amazon is different. They have fulfillment centers that ship ""Prime"" products. Recently they are only using U.S. P.S. They do not want to grant my request to De -Prioritize U.S. P.S. With their automatic shipping computers and instead insist that complaining to U.S. P.S. Will solve the problem. NO IT WILL NOT. I have also called U.S. P.S. Which is the biggest pain to talk to a live agent. The local postmaster is also hard to reach. Amazon also has independent sellers that ship the items by themselves. Because these items are very heavy, they do not use U.S. P.S. USUALLY BECAUSE expensive and or heavy items are not U.S. P.S. Specialty and any competent merchant knows that. And SO WHAT if U.S. P.S. Is cheaper! It is not right that these mega merchants are in bed with U.S. P.S. The reason why U.S. P.S. Is cheaper is because of subsidies and JUNK MAIL. Seriously get rid of the ORGANIZED CRIME that is U.S. P.S. And let the professional couriers take over. And do what I do: Stay out of Rural Areas (U.S. P.S. Has almost zero service in rural areas) and even better move inside the city limits. The larger the city, the better. And then you can drive a very short distance to actual stores.

Margie is constantly rude and we constantly have mail problems. Her response, ""you can spend more and ship through another service"", what a rotten attitude she displays!

Because of her and this post office in general, we no longer ship packages through USPS if and when we can avoid it!

I am so dissapointed with USPS. I had a mail that was said delivered on the same time I was at the location of the mailing address. I did not recieve anything it was said it was delivered. I went to the neighboring business they did not recieve any mail that was for us. My address is a business. We don't have a porch or a mailbox. Each time (very often) the mailman delivers our mail he hands it to us personally. But on that day considering I was there the whole day nothing is handed to me or even a sign he was there. I called my local post office at 2pm and told them about it, they said they'll call me back. At 3:30 I called back to make sure and check, they said they'll call me back at 4:30pm before they close. 6:00pm no callbacks. I called again at 1:30pm the next day asked about some updates and told them what happen again. They said they'll call me back and this time they promised. I waited, and I forgot it's past 5 but no callbacks still. I then called again the next day at 10am a little pissed of and all they have to tell me is ""it's been delivered to the address and we can't help u any further"" WT*? So i went and filed an insurance claim because it was $100 insured and I also filed a complaint. I still got denied on the claim for the reason that is already delivered.

Asked why they couldn't make a sign and was told, ""Oh, a sign requires that someone study the request and that a committee approves it.""

2. Had a package shipped to me with tracking that didn't update in two weeks. Called USPS, had the usual fight with the automated system that wants you to spend 27 minutes listening to USPS ads and not speak with a real person, then got to speak with an agent. Told her of my concern, gave her the tracking #, and she said, ""Let me look into that for you!"" Minutes later she comes back and says, ""Sir, your tracking didn't update, I don't know why.""

Our package had accidentally been addressed incorrectly - off by one number :( It was shaping up to be a real headache... we decided to ask our local p. O, 11377, for help, without much optimism. They received us with a smile, and we watched as they all tossed ideas around... the supervisor, Mr. Saiful Islam (new.?), came & asked us to wait on the side while he figured it out. I was consoling my husband who was so very sad when, not five minutes later, Mr. Islam returned to let us know that the package was still on the truck, and they were going to come back to 64th street to deliver it to the right address! I was in tears. Not even bc of the package, but the whole experience... it's well-known that the workers at the post office are overworked, underpayed, & screamed at 24-7 by unreasonable customers. Not to mention - they risk their lives daily they staying open during a pandemic. The fact that they continue to try to help and to be a positive influence is nothing short of saintly. I really want to thank not only Mr. Saiful Islam & his trusty associates for completely alleviating our problem- but the usps driver who went out of his way to make this an incredibly special christmas. He even came up the stairs, bless him :) we were so happy and pleased to be treated so kindly... they truly made our holiday... it was our christmas miracle :) THANK YOUUUU! Peace

The other boxes were stuck in NJ and NEVER arrived even until this day.

USPS is NOT a suitable option for international shipping the reason is because USPS is an independent agency of the United States federal government. IT IS A GOVERNMENT POST and it obviously does not have offices in other countries, what happens is that when a package is shipped to an international destination let's say a third world country like Indonesia or any other countries, USPS HANDS OVER your pacakge to the National post office of the destination country and a lot of countries have a crappy National post that tend to lose packages, this is especially true with third world countries. If you are shipping a package to a country that its national post has a reputable and trustworthy history and record in delivering packages, a country like Germany, UK, Canada, France, Austria, Australia then using USPS should not be an issue for international shipping but if you are shipping a package to a destination country that has a flimsy national post like Italy, Portugal, Spain, Estonia, Russia, Indonesia, Philippines... etc it is very likely that your package will be lost or stolen in the destination country which is not really USPS's fault.

Bottom line is: USPS is for domestic shipping
