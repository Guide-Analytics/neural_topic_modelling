58,60727604f85d750870550764,"Rushed onboarding, brusk customer support, confusion around pricing, but platform works",SG,"I reviewed the myriad choices for 3rd party fulfillment direct to customer. After extensive analysis of price and reviews, I landed on ShipHero. I was attracted to the idea of zone-less postage pricing, and found the company voice to be clear and concise. I reached out and started a conversation with their sales team.

The sales agent was clear but curt. I did appreciate that they did not attempt to follow up with me when I delayed for a significant period. When I did eventually confirm that I was moving forward, we scheduled a call for sales onboarding. This call was entirely too rushed, I could barely follow what the agent was talking about as we walked through the product user interface, which isn't a great feeling after you've finally pulled the trigger after careful and thorough research.

Following this, I was handed off to a customer support representative dedicated to onboarding. This person was definitely less curt, but she failed to correctly enter the type of packaging that I wanted to use for my product. And the web app has limited ability to enter certain information about your product, including what kind of package you want to use. That's something I'd love to have control over, I definitely don't want to be reaching out to customer support when something like that changes. As a result, a heavier package was used, and the shipping cost increased. Once you finish your onboarding with ShipHero, you can only contact customer support through the chat widget within the app. So I began communicating with the to fix the problem.

My experience with in-app customer support has been so-so. They say 20 minute average response time, but I've experiencing nothing shorter than 24 hour responses (it may not help that I'm in a timezone outside of the US). My interactions with these support agents have also been quite curt, though they did eventually solve the problem. However, the pricing on the ShipHero website is not clear when your unit weight is around 1lb. Apparently anything from 15oz to 16oz is rounded up to a pound, which I could not find clear language around on the pricing page. So now I'm paying more than I initially calculated for shipping, which was part of the reason why I chose ShipHero.

All that aside, my experience with sending inventory is so far smooth. And the product is going out to customers as expected. In reality, this is the most important part of their business, so I do appreciate that things are working correctly. But my interactions with customer support have definitely left much to be desired. I hope that as time moves forward, my impression will continue to improve. It's just a bit of a shame that my first impression is a bit murky.",2021-04-11T04:07:32.000Z,3,0,Jordan,2.0,2021-05-28 12:49:08.954908,2021-05-28 12:49:09.135818,ShipHero,Trustpilot

Carina is simply great. This level of support is what all good companies should aim for. It's almost like having a personal advisor. Thank you, Carina!!!!! <3

***UPDATE***

Unfortunately, I have to knock down three stars after a few months since I found several issues with the fulfillment process.

First, if you work with Shopify and you intend to sell part of your catalog using Ship hero, bear in mind that the app will display ALL store products and orders. For example, if you have 500 SKUS and use Shiphero to sell 60, the panel will display all store orders (mixed inventories), making it extremely difficult to track orders. The filters won't work as intended in my case. The engineers suggested deleting all non Shiphero products manually within the app, which is pointless since they sync daily repeatedly, and it is very time-consuming to delete products daily.

Secondly, the packaging rules were set wrongly. Instead of using our custom packages, we had dozens of orders shipped using Shiphero packaging, which increased the shipping cost substantially, losing profit from these orders. No compensation was offered but an apology. Thank God we checked the invoices and found out.

Finally, the eventual mistakes will happen (not shipping an order in time due to operator error), which is okay, but you will need to eat up the cost or customers' negative feedback. There is no responsibility on Shiphero's end at all.

I have to say that the support is still fast and reliable. I just wished I knew all of this in advance before sending our products here.",2021-05-03T11:46:25.000Z,6,0,Francisco V,2.0,2021-05-28 12:50:58.822346,2021-05-28 12:50:59.120462,ShipHero,Trustpilot

After my inventory worth $250,000 arrived in their warehouse, they claimed to find a bug in one of our products (from the 1000+ we had sent). This amount had my whole life savings and also credit from our reputable supplier. They threw all my inventory outside their warehouse and refused to accept delivery. My business launch was delayed by 2 months and I had to find another 3PL at the last minute. I also got all the products inspected and we did not find a single bug in any product. I still don't know why they did this. I requested, multiple times, just to investigate what happend. Most likely, a warehouse worker probably brought in some food to the warehouse and left it near our product to attract a bug there. The worst part was that they just treated it like it wasn't there problem anymore.

Best business decision i've made- Thank you Ship Hero,CA,"The infrastructure built and customer support for ShipHero is unlike anything i've ever experienced with a company before. Clara is an absolute sweetheart and lifesaver! Being someone with lacking technical skills, she explained things easily and clearly to me, and helped me every step of the way with all my questions. Everyone at this company cares about you and your success for running an efficient business.

Andrea who helped with the on-boarding process was so informative and excellent at addressing all my questions as well.

I am IN LOVE with this company, and after comparing many other 3PL companies - ShipHero is the absolute best. Free storage for 60 days, very competitive and transparent pricing , fast and easy fulfillment, top notch customer service chat when you need help. I am beyond thrilled that I came across ShipHero. It leaves all other 3PL's in the dust!
